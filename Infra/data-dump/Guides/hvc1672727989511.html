Four core elements of the program are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong"/>Management Commitment and Employee Involvement. The
               manager or management team leads the way, by setting policy, assigning and supporting
               responsibility, setting an example and involving employees.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong"/>Worksite Analysis. The worksite is continually analyzed to
               identify all existing and potential hazards.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong"/>Hazard Prevention and Control. Methods to prevent or
               control existing or potential hazards are put in place and maintained.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong"/>Training for Employees, Supervisors and Managers.
               Managers, supervisors and employees are trained to understand and deal with worksite
               hazards.</span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="hvc1672727989511__section_N1006C_N10040_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Management Commitment and Employee Involvement</h2><p class="p">The following are some examples of ways to encourage management commitment and employee involvement.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Post your safety and health policy next to the OSHA Workplace Poster where all employees can see it.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Hold a meeting with all employees to communicate your safety and health policy, and discuss your objectives for safety and health.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Make sure that your support is visible by getting personally involved in the activities that are part of your safety and health program. For example, personally review all inspection and accident reports and ensure that follow-up occurs when needed.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Ensure that you, your managers, and your supervisors follow all safety requirements that apply to all employees, even if you are only in an area briefly. If, for instance, you require a hard hat, safety glasses and/or safety shoes in an area, wear them yourself when you are in that area.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Take advantage of your employees' specialized knowledge and encourage them to buy into the program by having them make inspections, conduct safety training, or investigate accidents.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Make clear assignments of responsibility for every part of your safety and health program, and make sure everyone understands them.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Give those with safety and health responsibility enough people, time, training, money and authority to get the job done.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Recognize and reward those who do well and correct those who don't.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">At least once a year, review what you have accomplished in meeting your objectives and re-evaluate whether you need new objectives or program revisions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Institute an accountability system where all personnel will be held accountable for not following work rules designed to promote workplace safety and health.</span></li>

         </ul>

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Request a consultation visit from your state on-site OSHA Consultation Program covering both safety and health to get a full survey of the hazards that exist in your workplace and those that could develop. You can also contract for such services from expert private consultants if you prefer.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Establish a way to get professional advice when you make changes to procedures or equipment, to ensure that the changes are not introducing new hazards into your workplace. Find ways to keep current on newly recognized hazards in your industry.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Periodically review with employees each job, analyzing it step-by-step to see if there are any hidden hazards in the equipment or procedures.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Set up a self-inspection system to check your hazard controls and evaluate any new hazards.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Make sure your employees feel comfortable in alerting you or another member of management when they see things that look dangerous or out of place.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Learn how to conduct a thorough investigation when things go wrong. This will help you develop ways to prevent recurrences.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Review several years of injury or illness records to identify patterns that can help you devise strategies to improve your safety and health program. Periodically review several months of experience to determine if any new patterns are developing.</span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="hvc1672727989511__section_N100CA_N10040_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Hazard Prevention and Control:</h2><p class="p">Once you have identified your existing and potential hazards, you must implement the systems that prevent or control those hazards. As mentioned earlier, the basic formula for controlling workplace hazards, in order of preference, includes:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong"/>Engineering controls. The basic concept behind engineering
               controls is that, to the extent feasible, the work environment and the job itself
               should be designed to eliminate hazards or reduce exposure to hazards.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong"/>Safe work practices. These include your company's general
               workplace rules and other operation-specific rules. Depending on the type of industry
               and the operations, work practices for specific OSHA standards or to recognized
               hazards may be required.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong"/>Administrative controls. These are measures aimed at
               reducing employee exposure to hazards, such as additional relief workers, exercise
               breaks, and rotation of workers. These types of controls are normally used in
               conjunction with other controls that more directly prevent or control exposure to the
               hazard.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong"/>Personal protective equipment. When exposure to hazards
               cannot be engineered completely out of normal operations or maintenance work, and
               when safe work practices and other forms of administrative controls cannot provide
               sufficient additional protection, a supplementary method of control is the use of
               protective clothing or equipment.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Here are some actions to consider:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Set up safe work procedures based on an analysis of the hazards in your workplace and ensure that employees understand and follow them. It is a good idea to involve employees in the analysis that results in those procedures.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Be ready to enforce the rules for safe work procedures. Ask your employees to help you establish a disciplinary system that will be fair and understood by everyone.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Where necessary, ensure that personal protective equipment (PPE) is used and that your employees know why they need it, how to use it and how to maintain it.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide for regular equipment maintenance to prevent breakdowns that can create hazards. Ensure that preventive and regular maintenance are tracked to completion.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Plan for emergencies, including fire and natural disasters. Conduct frequent drills to ensure that all employees know what to do under stressful conditions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Ask your state consultant to help develop a medical program that fits your worksite. Involve nearby doctors and emergency facilities by inviting them to visit your workplace and help you plan the best way to avoid injuries and illness during emergency situations.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Ensure the ready availability of medical personnel for advice and consultation on matters of employee health. This does not mean that you must provide health care, but you must be prepared to deal with medical emergencies or health problems connected to your workplace.</span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="hvc1672727989511__section_N10115_N10040_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Training:</h2><p class="p">For the purpose of implementing a training program, here are some actions to consider:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Ask your state consultant to recommend training for your worksite.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Make sure you have trained your employees on every potential hazard that they could be exposed to and how to protect themselves. Then verify that they really understand what you taught them.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Pay particular attention to your new employees and to employees who are moving to new jobs. Because they are learning new operations, they are more likely to get hurt.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Train your supervisors to understand all the hazards faced by the employees and how to reinforce training with quick reminders and refreshers, or with disciplinary action if necessary.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Make sure that your top management staff understand their safety and health responsibilities and how to hold subordinate supervisory employees accountable for theirs</span></li>

      <section class="section" id="hvc1672727989511__section_N10136_N10040_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">OSHA's Consultation Program:</h2><p class="p">Employers having difficulty creating their own workplace safety program should contact the OSHA consultation program. The Office of Small Business Assistance was created to administer OSHA's nationwide On-Site Consultation Program and to serve as a liaison and a point of contact within the larger agency for small businesses.</p>
<p class="p">This OSHA Small Business Consultation Program provides free on-site consultation and assistance to employers in identifying and correcting specific hazards as well as developing and implementing injury and illness prevention programs. The program gives companies hands-on information on potential hazards at their worksites, improves their occupational safety and health management systems, and even qualifies them for a one-year exemption from routine OSHA inspections.</p>
<p class="p">In many states, employers may participate in the OSHA Consultation Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program (SHARP) that offers incentives and support to smaller, high-hazard employers to develop, implement, and continuously improve effective safety and health programs at their worksite. The program recognizes employers with demonstrated exemplary achievements in safety and health by receiving a comprehensive safety and health consultation visit, correcting all workplace safety and health hazards, adopting and implementing effective safety and health management systems, and agreeing to request further consultative visits if major changes in working conditions or processes occur that may introduce new hazards. Employers meeting these specific program requirements may be exempt from general scheduled OSHA inspections for one year.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">OSHA's Quick Start Program:</span></p>
<p class="p">OSHA also has an online step-by-step <span class="q">“Quick Start”</span> guide to help businesses learn more about how to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses. With this guide, employers can identify many of the major OSHA requirements and guidance materials that may apply to their workplace.

      <section class="section" id="hvc1672727989511__section_N1015A_N10040_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">OSHA guidance documents:</h2><p class="p">To assist employers with their compliance obligations under the OSH Act, OSHA has developed model documents that are available online:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The draft <a class="xref" href="http://https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/mtp101703.pdf" target="_blank">Model Training Program</a> for hazard communication is designed to help employers provide effective training to employees who are exposed to hazardous substances.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The <a class="xref" href="https://www.osha.gov/shpguidelines/" target="_blank">Safety and Health Program Management Guidelines</a> can help employers, especially small businesses (fewer than 250 employees per workplace), develop an overall workplace safety program.</span></li>

      <section class="section" id="hvc1672727989511__section_N1017D_N10040_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Additional Resources:</h2><p class="p"> Employers should also remember to tap into the resources of the chamber of commerce, industry trade associations, and other business organizations for assistance in creating a workplace safety program. Many of these organizations offer safety seminars and provide safety training literature free of charge or for a nominal fee. In addition, there are private consultants who can help small businesses establish safety programs meeting OSHA's regulatory standards. Finally, employers should have an insurance professional, a government representative, and an attorney review the finalized safety manual. </p>
