Among other things, the updated regulations:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Clarify that the prohibition on sex discrimination prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity, transgender status, and gender stereotypes as well as pregnancy, childbirth, and related conditions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Specify that denying accommodations for pregnancy, childbirth, or
               related medical conditions is <span class="ph strong">unlawful</span> if:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">The contractor denies accommodations only to employees affected
                     by pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions;</span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The contractor provides accommodations to other employees whose
                     ability or inability to perform their job duties is similarly affected, the
                     denial of accommodations imposes a significant burden on those employees, and
                     the contractor's asserted reasons for denying accommodations do not justify
                     that burden; <span class="ph em">or</span></span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Intent to discriminate is otherwise shown, for example, by
                     evidence of discriminatory statements made by managers when denying requested
                     accommodations.</span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Revise the definition of unlawful pay discrimination on the basis of sex. Contractors may not pay different compensation to similarly situated employees on the basis of sex and may not implement compensation practices that have an adverse impact on the basis of sex unless they can show them to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Expressly prohibit discrimination with regard to fringe benefits such as medical, hospital, accident, life insurance, and retirement benefits; profit-sharing and bonus plans; leave; and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Bar requirements for jobs or training that are based on an applicant's or employee's sex unless the contractor demonstrates that such requirements are a bona fide occupational qualification. Additionally, a contractor is prohibited from setting requirements, such as height or weight qualifications, that adversely affect applicants because of their sex unless it demonstrates that the qualifications are job-related and consistent with business necessity.</span></li>

         </ul>
