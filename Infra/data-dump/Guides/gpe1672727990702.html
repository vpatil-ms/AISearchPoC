      <p class="p">With the exception of military family caregiver leave (see the <cite class="cite">Reasons
            for Leave</cite> section for more information), FMLA leave is limited to a total of 12
         weeks per 12-month period, regardless of the number of FMLA-covered events the employee
         experiences during the year.</p>

      <p class="p">Employers are permitted to use any one of four methods to determine the
         12-month period for counting and tracking leave. The method selected must be used
         consistently and uniformly for all employees. </p>

      <div class="note note" id="gpe1672727990702__note_ct5_2kz_5xb"> 
         <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>If a state family and medical leave law requires a particular method, the employer must
            comply with that law.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="p">If an employer fails to select one of the four methods, the option that provides the most
         beneficial outcome for the employee must be used.</p>

      <section class="section" id="gpe1672727990702__section_N1004B_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Methods for Tracking Leave:</h2><p class="p">The four methods employers can use for the 12-month leave period are:</p>
<p class="p">The calendar year;</p>
<p class="p">Any fixed 12-month <span class="q">“leave year,”</span> such as a fiscal year, a year required by state law, or a year starting on an employee's anniversary date;</p>
<p class="p">The 12-month period measured forward from the date an employee's first FMLA leave begins; or</p>
<p class="p">A <span class="q">“rolling”</span> 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses FMLA leave.</p>

      <section class="section" id="gpe1672727990702__section_N10069_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Changes to Tracking Method:</h2><p class="p">If an employer wants to change to another method of tracking FMLA leave, the employer must give at least 60 days' notice to employees. Additionally, the transition must take place in such a way that eligible employees retain the full benefit of 12 weeks of leave under whichever method affords the greatest benefit to the employee.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="gpe1672727990702__section_N10073_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Tracking Intermittent or Reduced Schedule Leave:</h2><p class="p">When an employee takes FMLA leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis, the employer must account for the leave using an increment no greater than the shortest period of time that the employer uses to account for use of other forms of leave (such as vacation or paid time off).</p>
<p class="p">In general, under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), employers must pay an exempt employee their full salary in any workweek in which they perform work. However, under the FMLA, an employer may make deductions from an exempt employee's salary for any hours taken as intermittent or reduced FMLA leave.</p>

      <section class="section" id="gpe1672727990702__section_N10080_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Substitution of Paid Leave:</h2><p class="p">An employee has the right to substitute accrued paid leave for FMLA leave. The substitution of paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave means that the two types of leave run concurrently, with the employee receiving pay pursuant to the paid leave policy and receiving protection for the leave under the FMLA. If the employee does not choose to substitute applicable accrued paid leave, the employer may require the employee to do so, but must do so consistently for all similarly situated employees.</p>
