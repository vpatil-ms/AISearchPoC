      <section class="section" id="cbd1672727998211__section_N10064_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Small business exemptions:</h2><p class="p">Although small businesses are still subject to the OSH Act, they are exempt from some of its requirements. However, even with one employee, there are specific regulations that must be followed. For instance, all employers are required to report any accident that results in the hospitalization of three or more employees or the fatality of one employee. As such, it is important for all businesses, regardless of size, to ensure compliance.</p>
<p class="p">OSHA exempts small businesses with ten (10) or fewer employees from injury and illness reporting. In low-risk industries, there is a small business exemption from programmed inspections only. Businesses with ten (10) or less employees are exempt from programmed inspections, as long as they have an occupational injury lost workday rate lower than the national average, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).</p>
<p class="p">However, this inspection exception does not apply to the investigations triggered by safety complaints; reports of imminent danger or health hazards; accidents involving a fatality; or the hospitalization of three or more employees. An occupational injury lost workday rate higher than the national average can trigger an inspection for cause.</p>
<p class="p">As stated, small businesses in specified low-hazard industries are exempt from programmed inspections. The programmed inspections exemption, applies to the following low-hazard industries:</p>
