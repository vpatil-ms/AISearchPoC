But, times have changed, and so has the outlet for harassment. In today's digital world, there is the potential for harassing behavior to occur 24/7 with a click of a button.</p>
<p class="p">Below are a few examples of how technology can be used as a means for harassment:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">An employee sends a text message to a co-worker asking her out on a date </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Two employees are instant messaging and one sends a sexually suggestive message to the other </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employee posts a message on Facebook about a co-worker's physical appearance</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Text messaging, social networking sites, and instant messaging all demonstrate the changing face of sexual harassment. And, even though this type of contact may take place outside of normal work hours, it doesn't mean employers are no longer responsible for addressing it.</p>
<p class="p"> Since the avenues for sexual harassment can be more discrete these days, employers need to be extra vigilant in thwarting inappropriate behavior. Below are ways employers can help prevent sexual harassment:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Update your policy.</span> The foundation of any anti-harassment policy
            should be prevention. As obvious as it may be, clear language prohibiting sexual
            harassment is important for demonstrating the severity of the issue and your company's
            commitment to preventing inappropriate behavior. Clearly indicate that actions, words,
            jokes, comments, or any other conduct related to one's sex, race, ethnicity, age,
            religion, or any other protected characteristic will not be tolerated. And, because some
            harassers are now turning to the Internet or cell phones to engage in inappropriate
            behavior, employers should consider updating their policies to include these types of
            examples.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Redistribute your policy.</span> After updating any policy, it's important
            to redistribute it so employees are aware of the changes. Given the importance of your
            company's anti-harassment policy, you may also want to consider having employees
            acknowledge the policy on an annual basis. Bringing sexual harassment prevention to
            light can help demonstrate your good faith efforts at curbing the issue.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Set standards for after-hours conduct.</span> It's important to
            communicate to employees that your anti-harassment policy not only pertains to employee
            conduct during normal business hours, but outside the office as well, such as at company
            parties or off-site conferences. It should also be clear that the policy applies
            whenever employees communicate with one another, whether in person or not. This relates
            to communication via phone, text, email, or the Internet.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Recommend <span class="q">“safe surfing.”</span></span> If employees are concerned about
            mixing personal and professional contacts, they should be reminded that they have the
            option to maintain private Internet profiles on most social networking sites. Also,
            there are a variety of professional networking websites, such as LinkedIn, which may be
            preferred by employees who wish to keep their work-related contacts separate.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Demonstrate commitment.</span> Employers should take every claim seriously
            and communicate to employees that all complaints will be investigated. Employees will be
            more likely to report inappropriate behavior when they know their concerns will be
            addressed. Inform employees that they are expected to cooperate with an investigation
            and that providing false information during the course of an investigation is grounds
            for disciplinary action, up to an including termination of employment.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Document prevention efforts.</span> It is important to document and record
            all preventative actions taken. Documentation can be extremely useful in proving that
            the employer took reasonable measures to prevent inappropriate behavior. This means
            documenting proactive steps, such as trainings held, as well as reactive steps, such as
            investigative findings and disciplinary sanctions.</p>
<p class="p"> Employers have an obligation to take all steps necessary to prevent harassing behavior from occurring. Given the growing use of technology, those efforts may need to be re-evaluated. Regular communication pertaining to the issue as well as a formal plan for responding to such situations is of utmost importance. </p>
