      <p class="p">Employers subject to the employer mandate are required to offer full-time employees minimum
         health coverage that is deemed affordable, or face a penalty. For purposes of the ACA,
         full-time employees are those who perform an average of at least 30 hours of service per
         week. To determine which employees are considered full-time, large employers are to
         look-back at a defined measurement period. Generally, employees deemed full-time in the
         look-back measurement period must be provided health coverage for the same duration (known
         as the <span class="q">“stability period”</span>).</p>

      <section class="section" id="jqk1672727986640__section_N10047_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Look-back Measurement Period:</h2><p class="p">Because the hours worked by employees can sometimes vary, the IRS allows employers to choose to make the full-time determination based on a measurement period of no less than 3 months and no more than 12 months, also known as the <span class="q">“look-back measurement period”</span>. Employers may choose which months to use in order to make the calculation for full-time status, as long as the measurement period is applied on a uniform and consistent basis for all employees.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jqk1672727986640__section_N10055_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Stability Period:</h2><p class="p">Generally, those employees that are considered full-time during the look-back measurement period (excluding those part-time employees that made up full-time equivalents) will be considered full-time for the subsequent period of the same duration, or the <span class="q">“stability period”</span>, regardless of how many hours the employee works in the stability period. Therefore, those employees considered full-time and eligible for health coverage in the look-back period, will remain eligible for health coverage for the same time period going forward.</p>
<div class="note note" id="jqk1672727986640__note_N10062_N10055_N1003C_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>There is a 6-month minimum to the stability period. If the look-back measurement period is less than 6 months, the stability period going forward will remain 6 months. If the look-back measurement period is more than 6 months, the stability period will be equal to the entire look-back measurement period.</p>
</div>
<p class="p"> For example, an employee found to be full-time in a look-back period of July through November (4 months) as chosen by the employer, will be considered full-time and therefore eligible for benefits for a 6 month stability period going forward regardless of the number of hours the employee is working in that 6 month period as long as the employee remains employed in the stability period.</p>
<div class="note note" id="jqk1672727986640__note_N1006C_N10055_N1003C_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The stability period excludes any waiting period (or administrative period) that the employer has imposed on enrollment to the plan.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jqk1672727986640__section_N10072_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">New Employees:</h2><p class="p">If an employee has not been employed for at least one look-back measurement period, they are considered a new employee. Employers should determine if these <span class="q">“new employees”</span> are considered full-time (30 or more average hours per week in a given month) based on the expectation set at the time of hire. If the employee is reasonably expected to work full-time, then the employee must be treated as full-time immediately upon hire.</p>
