However, small employers are subject to other requirements under the ACA. Use the checklist below to help you understand some of these requirements.</p>

      <section class="section" id="yun1672727997887__section_N10055_N10048_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">All Employers</h2></section>

      <section class="section" id="yun1672727997887__section_N1005C_N10048_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Determine <span class="q">“employer size”</span> as it relates to the ACA:</h2><p class="p">Employers with 50 or more full-time and equivalent employees must offer full-time employees the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential health coverage. To determine employer size under the ACA, use the following steps:</p>
<ol class="concept">
            <li><span class="li">Determine controlled group status: A controlled group is a group of employers treated as a single employer under section <a class="xref" href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/epchd704.pdf" target="_blank">414(b), (c), (m), or (o) of the Internal Revenue Code</a>, and are counted as a single employer to determine whether together they employed 50 or more full-time and FTE employees in the prior calendar year.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Calculate number of full-time employees: Determine the number of employees who work an average of at least 30 hours per week.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Calculate number of FTEs: Add all the hours worked by your part-time employees (those working less than 30 hours per week) in a month and divide by 120. Note: If the part-time employee works more than 120 hours but less than 130 hours during the month, only 120 hours must be included in the calculation.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Arrive at a total number of FTEs: Add the number of full-time employees and FTE employees to arrive at your final number. Round down to the nearest whole number.</span></li>

         </ol>
<p class="p"><span class="q">“Small”</span> employers have less than 50 full-time and FTE employees and are not subject to the employer mandate. Arriving at this calculation can be complicated. Consider working with your tax advisor, insurance carrier and/or legal counsel.</p>

      <section class="section" id="yun1672727997887__section_N1008A_N10048_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Notify New Hires of Health Insurance Marketplace:</h2><p class="p">Employers must notify all new hires, regardless of their plan enrollment status or whether they are part-time or full-time, of the availability of the Health Insurance Marketplace within 14 days of hire.</p>
<p class="p">There are two Model Notices of Coverage Options: one for employers offering health coverage and one for employers not offering coverage.</p>

      <section class="section" id="yun1672727997887__section_N1009E_N10048_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Is your health plan considered <span class="q">“grandfathered”</span>?</h2><p class="p">Grandfathered plans are exempt from certain provisions of the ACA (see Grandfathered Plans for more information). To determine if you maintain grandfathered status, ask yourself:</p>
<ol class="concept">
            <li><span class="li">Was your plan in existence on March 23, 2010?</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Have you refrained from making <span class="q">“significant changes”</span> to the plan? Significant changes include but are not limited to, significantly cutting or reducing benefits, raising co-insurance charges, significantly raising co-payment charges, significantly raising deductibles, significantly lowering employer contributions, and adding or tightening an annual limit.</span></li>

         </ol>
<p class="p">If you answered <span class="q">“yes”</span> to both questions, your plan may be considered grandfathered. Plans
            that wish to maintain grandfathered status must include in plan materials a statement
            describing the benefits provided under the plan, that the plan believes it is a
            grandfathered health plan, and contact information for questions or complaints.</p>

      <section class="section" id="yun1672727997887__section_N100C2_N10048_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Does your plan offer <span class="q">“Essential Health Benefits”</span>?</h2><p class="p">The ACA requires that certain non-grandfathered group health plans offer a standard package of benefits referred to as <span class="q">“essential health benefits”</span> (see Major Insurance Reforms for more information). Review plan documents and work with your insurance carrier to ensure that essential health benefits are provided for all health plans.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="yun1672727997887__section_N100D4_N10048_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Does your plan offer <span class="q">“Preventive Services”</span>?</h2><p class="p">Under the ACA, all non-grandfathered health plans must cover <span class="q">“recommended”</span> preventive services and <span class="q">“routine”</span> immunizations without subjecting participants to cost-sharing measures when such services are delivered by an in-network provider (see Major Insurance Reforms for more information).</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Review plan documents and work with your insurance carrier to ensure that <span class="q">“recommended”</span> preventive services and <span class="q">“routine”</span> immunizations are covered in your health insurance plan.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Ensure these services are provided without subjecting participants to cost-sharing measures, such as a co-pay, deductible, or co-insurance, when such services are delivered by an in-network provider.</span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="yun1672727997887__section_N100FD_N10048_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Consider Other Health Insurance Reforms:</h2><p class="p">Employers that offer group health coverage should be familiar with additional insurance reforms under the ACA (see Major Insurance Reforms for more information). Work with your insurance carrier to ensure that your plan:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Prohibits annual dollar limits </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Has removed pre-existing conditions exclusions </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Covers dependents up to the age of 26 </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Restricts waiting periods to a maximum of 90 calendar days</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">This is not a full list of all insurance reforms under the ACA. To help ensure compliance, carefully evaluate your plan and work with your insurer on plan design.</p>

<p class="p">The ACA has established a grant program for employers with fewer than 100 employees that offer wellness programs. Note: Only non-grandfathered health plans are eligible. To help assess eligibility, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Do you have less than 100 employees?</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Did you have a wellness program in place on March 23, 2010? Employers may be
               eligible for grants only if they did not have a wellness program in place on March
               23, 2010.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Does your wellness program meet the <span class="q">“reasonable design”</span> rule? Generally, a wellness program is reasonably designed if it has a reasonable chance of improving the health or preventing disease in participating employees.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Does your wellness program include the necessary elements? The program must include health awareness initiatives, efforts to maximize employee engagement, initiatives to change unhealthy behaviors and lifestyle choices, and supportive environments to encourage healthy lifestyles.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">See Wellness Plans and Incentives for more information.</p>
