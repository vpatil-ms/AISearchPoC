<p class="p"> Common types of bonuses:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Sign-on bonus.</span> Sign-on bonuses are sometimes used to
               entice talented employees to accept employment with you.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Retention bonus.</span> This type of bonus can be used as an
               incentive for a valuable employee to remain with the company. Typically retention
               bonuses are paid after the employee has been with the company for a certain period of
               time (e.g., one year).</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Annual or holiday bonus.</span> This type of bonus is a way
               for employers to recognize and reward employee accomplishments throughout the
               year.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Below you will find some best practice recommendations related to bonuses:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Evaluate if it's in the budget:</span> The amount offered or
               whether a bonus will be provided at all, should depend on company earnings and
               whether the company has achieved certain targets throughout the year. Before making
               any promises or dipping into the company's cash flow, it's important to consider
               whether a bonus is something that the company is in the position to provide.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">It's supposed to be about appreciation:</span> It's the
               thought that counts. So if you can't afford a bonus, think of other creative ways to
               show your employees that they're appreciated. Simple forms of recognition, such as
               praise, thank you notes, and even an extra paid day off is something we can all use a
               little more of. These simple gestures can serve to drive employee productivity, even
               during the end of the year <span class="q">“slump.”</span></span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Determine amount:</span> The amount of the bonus should be
               based upon company financials. While there is no widespread formula used to calculate
               employee bonuses, 5-10% of an employee's salary is typical for lower-level staff and
               10-20% is more common for management level employees.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Tie bonuses to performance:</span> When rewards are tied to
               job performance, employees are more likely to put forth the effort and produce
               quality results. On the contrary, when employees come to expect bonuses <span class="q">“just
                  because”</span>, their performance is likely to remain marginal.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Plan a bonus structure carefully:</span> Large differences in
               pay-outs may cause hostility among employees, especially if some have been with the
               company longer than others. When dispensing bonuses think fair and equitable
               distribution, either based on seniority, job performance, or some combination of the
               two. However you go about determining bonus amounts, be sure the process is fair,
               free from bias, and is applied consistently.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Manage employee expectations:</span> There may be some years
               in which administering bonuses just isn't practical. Because they aren't always
               predictable, company bonuses should never be etched in stone or in any way promised
               to employees. If your company has regularly given holiday bonuses, but will be unable
               to this year, try to let employees know as early as possible; many employees may
               factor in their bonus as part of their yearly earnings.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Never make any promises:</span> Bonuses that are
               discretionary are not usually viewed as implied contracts. But, those offered to
               encourage employees to achieve some desired goal are likely to be held enforceable
               once employees satisfy whatever criteria you have established to qualify for the
               bonus. Employers promising this for that will likely be required to uphold their end
               of the bargain. One way to help avoid confusion is to communicate publicly (and
               often) that bonuses are awarded entirely at the discretion of management and are not
               intended to be binding. </span></li>
