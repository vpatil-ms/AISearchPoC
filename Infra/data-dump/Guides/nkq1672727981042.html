In addition, many employers have instituted fraud units in their companies. These developments have already made quite a dent in workers' compensation costs.</p>
<p class="p">The most effective ways to investigate workers comp claims to safeguard against fraud are as follows;</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Employer monitoring.</span> While most employees on workers'
               compensation follow their medical rehabilitation programs conscientiously, evidence
               suggests that a minority of employees fabricate symptoms, cancel physical therapy
               appointments, and are insincere about getting off compensation and back on the job.
               The costs fall not only on employers, but also on the malingerer's fellow employees.
               By forcing the payment of wages for no work and wasting money on medical treatment,
               the employer is forced to skimp on such things as pay raises, safety programs, and
               fringe benefits. Be on the lookout for the following common signs of malingering and
               possible fraud.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Employee was new to job when injury was reported.</span>
               Typically, abusers of the system have no intention of doing any actual work, and they
               will usually try to arrange things so that they don't have to spend any more time
               than necessary on the job.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Injury is reported immediately before a work stoppage of
                  some kind.</span> While everyone else has to struggle through a strike, layoff, or
               shutdown without regular pay, the malingerer continues to collect without
               interruption.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Injury is reported Monday morning, and there are no
                  witnesses.</span> People who get hurt over the weekend sometimes try to turn their
               injuries into cash by faking an accident at work.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Spotty work history.</span> Malingerers frequently get caught
               and have to move on. Look for periods of unexplained idleness in their work
               records.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Employee is difficult to reach.</span> An employee who is
               disabled from an on-the-job injury should be at home during the day. An employee who
               can't be reached by telephone could be working another job or even away.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Frequent change of care-providers.</span> No sooner does the
               doctor catch on that there's mischief afoot then the malingerer changes physicians,
               hoping to stretch out the disability payments just a bit longer.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Report claims promptly to the insurer, and be sure to notify the insurer or attorney if there is reason to believe that a claim is not based on a valid injury. Alert the insurer to any signs of malingering. Compile a <span class="q">“repeater list”</span> to show which employees are improperly trained, improperly qualified, or <span class="q">“professional claimants.”</span></p>
