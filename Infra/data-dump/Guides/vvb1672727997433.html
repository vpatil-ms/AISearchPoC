      <p class="p">Under the FLSA employers have an obligation to keep records of hours worked and wages paid.
         Employers can use a variety of timekeeping methods to keep track of the hours employees
         work.</p>

      <section class="section" id="vvb1672727997433__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Timekeeping methods:</h2><p class="p">Common timekeeping methods include written timesheets, time clocks, and online systems. Recently, many employers have moved to electronic timekeeping systems, such as ADP's eTimecard or ezLaborManager®.</p>

      <section class="section" id="vvb1672727997433__section_N1004D_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Timekeeping for exempt employees:</h2><p class="p">Employers are not required to track exempt employees' hours. However, some employers do for attendance purposes. Keep in mind that employers are generally prohibited from making deductions from an exempt employee's salary on the basis of hours worked. So while you may track exempt employees' hours, you generally cannot reduce their pay based on the number of hours worked.</p>

      <section class="section" id="vvb1672727997433__section_N10057_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Time rounding:</h2><p class="p">It is a best practice to record time worked to the minute. However, under the FLSA, employers may round employees' hours as long as it is shown that over time, the averages result in payment for all the time actually worked. You may round to the nearest minute, five minutes or even up to 15 minutes at the beginning and/or the end of employees' shifts. However, your rounding policy cannot consistently round in the company's favor or result in the failure to count all the time employees have actually worked.</p>
