      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Determining Your Staffing Needs</h2><p class="p">Identify business needs to determine whether you need someone on a full-time, part-time, or temporary basis.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Full-Time and Part-Time:</h2><p class="p">The definitions of full-time and part-time vary depending on law and policy. Most employers determine full-time status based on business needs and typically consider an employee to be full-time if they work anywhere from 32 to 40 or more hours per week. Depending on your business, you may generally choose to provide both full-time and part-time employees with benefits, such as paid time off and health insurance. Typically, part-time employees are provided with benefits on a pro-rated basis.</p>
<div class="note note"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Regardless of your company's definition of full-time status, coverage under various employment laws is based on the definition provided in the law. For instance, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), full-time means working, on average, at least 30 hours per week.</p>
</div>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Temporary:</h2><p class="p">If you need to fill a vacancy due to a temporary need, (i.e., as a result of a full-time employee being out on leave or disability), then a temporary employee may be a viable option. Temporary employees are generally not eligible for company benefits.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Seasonal:</h2><p class="p">If business picks up during certain times of the year, consider hiring employees just for those occasions. For example, retail establishments hire these types of workers during the holiday season and parks and recreation facilities hire these workers during the summer months.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Interns:</h2><p class="p">Internships are temporary arrangements whereby a student obtains entry-level experience in a job or field they are interested in. The relationship offers a unique opportunity for students to learn vital skills and for a business to evaluate potential hires.</p>
<p class="p">Unless very narrow tests are satisfied, internships must be paid. For more information, see the Department of Labor's test.</p>
