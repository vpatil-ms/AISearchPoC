To be classified as exempt, an employee must generally be paid on a salary basis, meet the minimum salary requirement, and perform certain duties. Carefully evaluate the employee's salary and job duties, not their job title, when determining if an exemption applies.</p>

<p class="p">Employers are permitted to make a final <span class="q">“catch-up”</span> payment within one pay period after the end of year to bring an employee's compensation up to the required level.

Then, if at the end of the year, the employee's paid-out salary plus the nondiscretionary bonuses and incentive payments (including commissions) does not equal at least $35,568, the employer would have one pay period to make up for the shortfall.</p>
