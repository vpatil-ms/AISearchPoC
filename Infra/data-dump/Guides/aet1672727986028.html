      <p class="p">As an employer, you must assess your workplace to determine if hazards are present that
         require the use of personal protective equipment. If such hazards are present, you must
         select protective equipment and require workers to use it, communicate your protective
         equipment selection decisions to your workers, select personal protective equipment that
         properly fits your workers, and train employees how to use it.</p>

      <p class="p">Using personal protective equipment is often essential, but it is generally the last line
         of defense after engineering controls, work practices, and administrative controls.
         Engineering controls involve physically changing a machine or work environment.
         Administrative controls involve changing how or when workers do their jobs, such as
         scheduling work and rotating workers to reduce exposures. Work practices involve training
         workers how to perform tasks in ways that reduce their exposure to hazards.</p>

      <section class="section" id="aet1672727986028__section_N10047_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Payment for PPE:</h2><p class="p">Employers are required to provide employees with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at no cost to the employee, when such equipment is already required by OSHA.</p>
<p class="p">Personal protective equipment includes the types of equipment most commonly used to protect the head, torso, arms, hands, and feet. The PPE payment rule includes exceptions for certain ordinary protective equipment, such as safety-toe footwear, prescription safety eyewear, logging boots, and everyday clothing and weather-related gear. In addition, the PPE provision does not cover uniforms, caps, or other clothing employees wear solely for the purpose of identifying themselves as a member of the company.</p>
<p class="p">If PPE is not required by OSHA, the employer is not required to pay the employee for the PPE used. In addition, should employees choose to use PPE that they own, employers will not be required to reimburse them; however, an employee's use of their own PPE is strictly voluntary. If employees do use their own PPE, employers are required to ensure that the employees' PPE is adequate to protect against workplace hazards.</p>
<p class="p"> Employers are required to pay for replacement PPE, except when an employee loses or intentionally damages their equipment that was provided, and paid for, by the company. </p>
