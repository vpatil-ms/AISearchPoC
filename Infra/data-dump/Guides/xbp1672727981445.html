      <p class="p">The FLSA requires employers to pay all non-exempt employees at least the minimum wage per
         hour. Some states, industries, and local jurisdictions have set their own minimum wage
         rates. In this case, the employer must pay the highest minimum wage per hour.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xbp1672727981445__section_N1004D_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Exempt vs. Non-exempt:</h2><p class="p">In general, non-exempt employees must be paid at least the minimum wage per hour for all time worked and overtime if they work more than 40 hours in a workweek. Most employees must be classified as non-exempt.</p>
<p class="p">Exempt employees (with certain exceptions) must be paid a weekly salary that (also with certain exceptions) cannot be reduced in any week in which the employee performs any work. Exempt employees are not entitled to overtime, regardless of how many hours they work. To qualify as exempt, employees must satisfy narrow tests (see Tests for Determining Exempt Status).</p>

      <section class="section" id="xbp1672727981445__section_N1005A_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Living &amp; Prevailing Wages:</h2><p class="p">Local laws may require employers to pay city employees and the employees of companies benefiting from city contracts or subsidies a <span class="q">“living wage”</span> that is greater than the federal minimum wage. In addition, the federal Davis-Bacon Act and Walsh Healey Act require employers to pay prevailing wages to employees working on public construction projects under federal contracts.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xbp1672727981445__section_N10068_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Sub-minimum Wage:</h2><p class="p">The FLSA permits certain individuals to be paid at a rate below the statutory minimum. The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) may authorize such an arrangement in order to increase employment opportunities for certain groups, but some states and local jurisdictions prohibit this practice. Employment under these circumstances is only permitted under certificates issued by the WHD.</p>
<p class="p">Under the FLSA, individuals that may be paid at a rate below the statutory minimum wage include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Student-learners (vo­cational education students), as well as full-time students in retail or service establishments, agriculture, or institutions of higher education</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Individuals whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by a physical or mental disability</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Additionally, employees under the age of 20 may be paid a sub-minimum wage of no less than $4.25 per hour for the first 90 consecutive calendar days of employment.</p>
<p class="p">Employers are prohibited from taking any action to displace current employees in order to hire employees at a subminimum wage.</p>
