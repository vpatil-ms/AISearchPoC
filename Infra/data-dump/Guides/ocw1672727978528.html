<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">COBRA Continuation Coverage:</span> A temporary extension of
               group health plan coverage at group rates after certain events that would otherwise
               cause an individual to lose his or her group health plan coverage.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Qualifying Event:</span> An event that causes an individual
               to lose group health plan coverage and trigger his or her right to elect COBRA
               continuation coverage. Examples of qualifying events include voluntary or involuntary
               job loss, reduction in the hours worked, divorce, and loss of dependent child
               status.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Qualified Beneficiary:</span> An individual covered by a
               group health plan on the day before a qualifying event (a covered employee, the
               covered employee's spouse, or a covered employee's dependent child). Any child born
               to or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of COBRA
               continuation coverage is automatically considered a qualified beneficiary. Each of
               the qualified beneficiaries for a qualifying event may independently elect COBRA
               continuation coverage.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Dependent Child:</span> A child who receives group health
               plan coverage under his or her parent's group health plan.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Election Period:</span> A period in which Qualified
               Beneficiaries are allowed to choose whether to elect COBRA continuation coverage. The
               election period must end no earlier than the later of the following two dates:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">60 days after the date coverage would otherwise terminate under the plan
                     because of the Qualifying Event; or</span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">60 days after the date the Qualified Beneficiary was notified of the right to
                     elect COBRA Continuation Coverage</span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Plan Administrator: </span>The individual or organization
               directly responsible for carrying out the requirements of COBRA. Some group health
               plans are administered by the employer, but most group health plans are administered
               by a third party.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">COBRA General Notice:</span> A notice that contains important
               information about COBRA continuation coverage. The notice must be given by the Plan
               Administrator to each covered employee and their spouse who becomes covered under the
               group health plan.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">COBRA Election Notice:</span> A notice that describes the
               rights to COBRA continuation coverage and how to make an election for such coverage.
               The election notice must be provided by the Plan Administrator to Qualified
               Beneficiaries following a qualifying event.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Multi-Employer Plan:</span> Generally, an employee health
               plan maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement that includes employees
               of two or more employers who are required to contribute to the plan. These plans are
               also known as jointly-administered plans. </span></li>
