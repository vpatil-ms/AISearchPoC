</section>

      <section class="section" id="ycs1672727992015__section_N1005D_N10050_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA):</h2><p class="p">Under federal law, USERRA provides leave, reemployment, and other rights and protections to employees in the uniformed services. Eligible employees are entitled to five years of leave for military service and an unlimited amount of leave for military training and drills.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employee Notice:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employees must provide reasonable advance notice of their need for military leave, unless such notice was prohibited by military necessity or otherwise impossible. The employee is under no obligation to ask for or get permission to take military leave; they're only required to give notice when foreseeable.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Pay:</span></p>
<p class="p">Military leave is unpaid; however, employers must allow (but cannot require) employees to use earned paid time off during leave. Exempt employees called to active duty must be paid their full salary if they work any part of the week in which they were activated and/or return to work.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Benefits:</span></p>
<p class="p">While on military leave, an employee is entitled to the non-seniority rights and benefits generally provided by the employer to other employees that are on a leave of absence for other reasons. The law also requires employers that sponsor a health plan to continue coverage according to the following schedule:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Leave lasting 30 days or less:</span> The
               employee continues to pay their normal share of the health insurance premium and upon
               return from service, health insurance coverage must continue as if there had been no
               absence.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Leave lasting 31 days or more: Group health insurance must continue for up to 24 months of service. These employees may be required to pay the full cost of the health care premium, plus a 2% administrative fee.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Job Reinstatement:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employees returning from military leave must generally be reinstated to the job that they would have attained had they remained continuously employed. Returning employees must notify their employer of their intention to return within certain minimum timeframes, which are based on their length of service.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ycs1672727992015__section_N1008A_N10050_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">FMLA Military Leave:</h2><p class="p">Under the FMLA (which applies to employers with 50 or more employees), eligible employees are entitled to use up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave entitlement to address certain qualifying exigencies that arise out of the fact that their spouse, son, daughter, or parent is on covered active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty) in the Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="p">Also under the FMLA, eligible employees may take up to 26 workweeks of unpaid leave to care for a covered service member or covered veteran with a serious injury or illness that occurred while on active duty or was aggravated due to his or her active duty.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ycs1672727992015__section_N10097_N10050_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">State Military Leave:</h2><p class="p">Many states have their own military leave laws, some which require leave for civil air patrol training or missions, or require smaller employers to provide family military leave.</p>
<p class="p"> Generally, where federal, state, and local laws conflict, the law that is more generous to the employee applies.</p>
