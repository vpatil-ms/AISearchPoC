      <section class="section" id="qrf1672727984668__section_N1004B_N10048_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">National Origin Discrimination</h2><p class="p">An employer with 15 or more employees may not harass or discriminate against an employee or an applicant based on national origin, under Title VII. Many state laws also prohibit this type of discrimination and harassment. This provision means that an employer cannot make decisions based on an individual's birthplace, ancestry, culture, native language, accent (unless the accent affects the individual's ability to perform the job); marriage or association with people of a national ethnic group; and membership or connection with a ethnic, educational, religious, or cultural organization associated with a specific ethnic group. This law against national origin discrimination applies to every stage of the employment relationship, including job advertisements, interviewing, hiring, compensation, benefits, promotion, discipline, job evaluations, demotion, training, job assignments, layoff, and termination.</p>
<p class="p">Employers must also be aware of any harassment against someone of a specific national origin who finds it difficult, if not impossible, to work effectively in a hostile work environment. This includes ethnic slurs, workplace graffiti, or other offensive conduct concerned with an individual's birthplace, ethnicity, culture, or foreign accent. This applies to harassment initiated by anyone associated with the worker, including managers, coworkers, customers or business partners.</p>
<p class="p">Determining whether the environment is hostile enough to be considered harassment is based on:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Whether conduct was physically threatening or intimidating </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The frequency of the conduct </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Whether the conduct was hostile and/or patently offensive </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The situation in which the harassment took place </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">How management responded when learning of the harassment</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Both employers and employees have critical roles to play in the prevention of harassment based on national origin. An employer's failure to take necessary steps to prevent or correct harassment may contribute to their liability for unlawful harassment. Similarly, if an employee does not take reasonable steps to report harassment, he or she may preclude the possibility of holding an employer responsible for the harassment.</p>
<p class="p">Overall, employers are liable for unlawful harassment by a supervisor unless they can demonstrate that:</p>
<ol class="concept">
            <li><span class="li">They exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.</span></li>

         </ol>
<p class="p">Employers are liable for harassment based on national origin by coworkers or non-employees if the employers knew or should have known about the harassment and did not take immediate and appropriate corrective action.</p>
<p class="p">It is most important for an employer to clearly communicate to all personnel that harassment based on national origin will not be tolerated and that anyone who violates this provision will be subject to disciplinary action. Further, an employer should have clearly communicated policies and procedures for addressing complaints of national origin harassment and train managers on how to effectively identify and respond to them.</p>
<p class="p">Employees who are harassed should take appropriate steps as soon as possible to prevent the continuation of the misconduct. In some instances, the employee may feel comfortable addressing the issue with the offending employee or supervisors. In other situations in which the employee believes the employer needs to intervene to prevent further harassment, that employee should notify the official designated by the employer's complaint or harassment policy. If it is not possible to notify the appropriate official such as a supervisor, since that person is the offender, the employee may have to notify another appropriate official.</p>

      <section class="section" id="qrf1672727984668__section_N1008C_N10048_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">English Fluency and English-Only Rules:</h2><p class="p">An employer may require an employee to speak fluent English only if fluency in English is necessary to perform the job effectively. Because the degree of fluency that may be lawfully required varies from one position to the next, employers should avoid fluency requirements that apply uniformly to a broad range of dissimilar positions. The employer should not require a greater degree of fluency than is necessary for the relevant position.</p>
<p class="p">Title VII permits employers to adopt English-only rules under limited circumstances. An <span class="q">“English-only rule”</span>, which requires employees to speak only English on the job, is only allowed if it is needed to ensure the safe or efficient operation of the employer's business and is put in place for nondiscriminatory reasons. An employer's use of an English-only rule should relate to specific circumstances in the workplace. An employer should never prohibit employees from speaking other languages during lunch breaks or other situations unrelated to safe and efficient operation of the business.</p>
<p class="p">An English-only rule is justified by <span class="q">“business necessity”</span> if needed for an employer to operate safely or efficiently, such as:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">For communication with customers, coworkers, or supervisors who only speak English </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">In emergencies or other situations in which workers must speak a common language to promote safety </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">For cooperative work assignments where the English-only rule is needed to enhance efficiency </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">In order to allow an English-speaking supervisor to monitor the performance of an employee whose job duties require communication with coworkers or customers</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">EEO guidelines give the following as an example of a well-worded English-only policy:</p>
<p class="p">XYZ Petroleum Corp. operates an oil refinery and has a rule requiring all employees to speak only
            English during an emergency. The rule also requires that employees speak in English
            while performing job duties in laboratories and processing areas where there is the
            danger of fire or explosion. The rule does not apply to casual conversations between
            employees in the laboratory or processing areas when they are <span class="ph em">not</span> performing a job duty. The English-only rule does not violate Title VII
            because it is narrowly tailored to safety requirements.</p>
<p class="p">Before adopting an English-only rule, the employer should consider whether there are any alternatives that would be just as effective in promoting safety or efficiency.</p>

For instance, a retail business that is located in a predominantly Spanish-speaking neighborhood may require that some of its employees speak Spanish. As with English fluency requirements, foreign language fluency requirements must be necessary to carry out the essential functions of the position. A company with a diverse clientele may assign different work to each employee. For example, bilingual employees may provide services to customers who speak Spanish, while English-speaking workers may do the same for those who converse in English. Of course, employers should make such assignments based on language ability. In most cases, employers are not required by Title VII to provide additional compensation for work that is performed in a foreign language.</p>
