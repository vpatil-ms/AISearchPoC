      <p class="p">The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) requires employers to complete <a class="xref" href="http://www.hr411.com/library/download.php?hritem=69915" target="_blank">Form I-9</a> for each newly hired employee. Section 1 of the I-9
         form must be completed on the employee's first day of work. Section 2, which requires
         employers to review and verify supporting documents, must be completed within three
         business days of the employee's start date.</p>

      <section class="section" id="crg1672727995629__section_N1004A_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Photocopies of Supporting Documents:</h2><p class="p">Some employers choose to photocopy employees' presented documents. Note that when an employer participates in <a class="xref" href="http://www.uscis.gov/e-verify" target="_blank">E-Verify</a> and the employee presents certain documents, the employer must retain a photocopy of the document. If you do decide to make photocopies of presented documents you must do so consistently for all employees. Photocopies may only be used for the verification process and should be retained with the employee's I-9.</p>

      <section class="section" id="crg1672727995629__section_N1005B_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Retention:</h2><p class="p">The completed I-9 form must be retained for three years following an employee's date of hire or one year following their termination, whichever is later. It is a best practice to store all I-9 forms together in one file so that they can be promptly produced following an official government request. I-9s must be produced within three days of such a request.</p>

Otherwise, you may re-verify their employment eligibility by completing Section 3 of the form. If the employee's original form of identification has expired, you will need to examine a document that reflects current employment eligibility and record the document title, number, and expiration date within this section.</p>

Complete Section 3 when updating and/or re-verifying Form I-9.</p>
