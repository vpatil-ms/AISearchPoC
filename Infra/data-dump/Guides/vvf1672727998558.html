      <p class="p">Apart from lactation breaks (see the Breaks for Nursing Mothers section for more
         information), the FLSA does not require employers to offer rest or meal breaks. However,
         the FLSA does have certain rules employers must follow when meal or rest breaks are
         provided. Note: Many state laws require employers to provide breaks.</p>

      <section class="section" id="vvf1672727998558__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Rest Breaks:</h2><p class="p">Compensation:</p>
<p class="p">Under the FLSA, if a rest break is provided, it must be paid. The DOL defines a rest break as any period lasting 20 minutes or less that the employee is allowed to spend away from work.</p>
<p class="p">Frequency:</p>
<p class="p">Consider your state law when determining the frequency and duration of rest breaks. Additionally, employers may want to consider the mental and physical demands of the job, the length and time of day of the shift, the environment in which the work is performed, as well as customer demand and other business requirements.</p>
<p class="p">Unauthorized Extensions:</p>
<p class="p">Generally, when employees take unauthorized extensions of rest breaks, the time must be paid if the rest period lasts 20 minutes or less. However, the FLSA permits employers to exclude unauthorized extensions of rest periods from hours worked as long as the employer expressly and clearly advises employees that:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Breaks may only last for a specified duration (e.g., 10 minutes); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Unauthorized extensions of breaks are prohibited; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Violations of the policy will be punished.</span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="vvf1672727998558__section_N1006B_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Meal Breaks:</h2><p class="p">Under the FLSA, whether a meal period must be paid depends on the circumstances. An unpaid meal period is one in which an employee:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Has at least 30 minutes without interruption; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Is fully relieved of all duties for the purpose of eating a regular meal.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">If the above conditions are met, the meal period can be unpaid.</p>
<div class="note note" id="vvf1672727998558__note_N10082_N1006B_N1003C_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The employee is not relieved of his or her duties if he or she is required to perform any work, whether active or inactive, while eating. For example, an office employee who is required to eat at his desk and be ready to take calls if the phone rings must be compensated for all time spent eating, even if there are no incoming calls.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">State Impact:</p>
<p class="p">Some states have specific rules governing meal periods, including the frequency, timing, and duration of such breaks. In addition, under some state laws, requiring employees to stay on the premises or imposing other restrictions may affect whether the meal period is paid or unpaid. Check your state law for additional guidance on meal periods.</p>
