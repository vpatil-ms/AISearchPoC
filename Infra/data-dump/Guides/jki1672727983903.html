      <p class="p">Under the FLSA, employers must pay non-exempt employees overtime at a rate of 1.5 times the
         employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek. The FLSA does
         not require overtime pay for work on Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, or regular days of rest,
         although certain states do.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jki1672727983903__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Exceptions:</h2><p class="p">Certain executive, professional, administrative, computer professional, outside sales, and highly compensated employees may be exempt from minimum wage and/or overtime requirements (see Tests for Determining Exempt Status).</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="jki1672727983903__section_N1004D_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">State and Local Impact:</h2><p class="p">Some states and local jurisdictions provide workers greater overtime protections than the FLSA. For instance, California requires overtime pay for, among other things, all hours worked over eight in a workday in addition to all hours worked over 40 in a workweek. Check your state law to ensure compliance.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jki1672727983903__section_N10057_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Workweek Defined:</h2><p class="p">A workweek consists of seven consecutive 24-hour periods. It can begin on any day and at any hour of the day as long as it is a fixed and regularly recurring period of 168 hours.</p>
<p class="p">Each workweek must be considered separately in determining overtime hours, regardless of the length of the pay period. Therefore, employers who pay their employees on a bi-weekly basis may not offset time worked over 40 hours in one week against time worked under 40 hours in another week (except for certain arrangements permitted for hospital and nursing home employees, firefighters, and law enforcement personnel).</p>

Generally, the regular rate includes but is not limited:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Salary or hourly rate of pay </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Reasonable cost of employer-provided room and board </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">On-call pay </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Cash payments under a cafeteria plan</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Certain payments made to employees are excluded from the regular rate calculation, including but are not limited to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Gifts </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Payments made for vacation, holiday, or illness </span></li>

You may subject your employees to your company's disciplinary action policy for failing to follow company policy, but in no case may you withhold pay. </p>
