      <p class="p">Once you have posted your job ad, you will start to receive resumes, cover letters, and
         other relevant information from interested candidates. By establishing a clearly defined
         pre-screening process, you can help narrow the applicant pool down to the most qualified
         candidates.</p>

      <p class="p">Depending on the role, pre-screening may include, but is not limited to:</p>

Pre-screening questions should be tailored to the role.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ept1672727990170__section_N10066_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reviewing Resumes:</h2><p class="p">Resumes are another valuable tool for assessing a candidate's qualifications, including their employment history, skills, and accomplishments. However, because resumes allow applicants to provide information in a format and style of their choice, it generally means resumes provide you with the information that the applicant wants to share. Resumes should always be used in conjunction with an employment application and other pre-employment assessments.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ept1672727990170__section_N10070_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Application Forms:</h2><p class="p">Application forms allow you to collect information about work history, educational background, and qualifications in a standardized way. This can make it easier to compare candidates to one another. Application forms also allow you to request job-related information candidates usually exclude from resumes, such as reasons for leaving previous jobs.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ept1672727990170__section_N10080_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Pre-employment Tests:</h2><p class="p">The use of reliable and valid pre-employment tests is another way to help identify qualified candidates. Depending on the type of position, pre-employment tests may be used to assess personality, knowledge/skills, or cognitive abilities. When using pre-employment tests, ensure they are job-related, reliable and valid, and avoid relying solely on such results when making selection decisions.</p>
<div class="note note" id="ept1672727990170__note_N1008A_N10081_N1003C_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Certain pre-screening tools have the potential to reveal protected class information. Use extreme caution when requiring candidates to upload video or voice recordings or answer questions that may unintentionally elicit protected information. Be mindful of applicable federal, state and local anti-discrimination laws as you implement pre-screening tools and review responses. All selection decisions must be job-related.</p>
