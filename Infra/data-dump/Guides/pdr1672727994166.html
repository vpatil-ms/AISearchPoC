By doing so the employer assures the employee provides sufficient medical certification stating they are healthy enough to return to work once their injury has subsided.</p>
<p class="p">The restoration of an experienced employee is of far greater value to the company than bringing an inexperienced and untried worker on board. Returning a regular, experienced employee back to the job can bring substantial benefit savings and improve productivity. Further, there is evidence that employees who return to work quickly are less likely to seek an attorney than those who remain on disability leave.</p>
<p class="p">Some states have laws requiring the employer to offer an injured employee a modified duty or light duty job. In the states that have such <span class="q">“return to work”</span> laws, the employer does not have to create a new job, but if one is available and the employee can perform it, it must be offered.</p>
