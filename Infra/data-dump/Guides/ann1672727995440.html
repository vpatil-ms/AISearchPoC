      <section class="section" id="ann1672727995440__section_N10056_N1004C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">What types of injuries does WC cover?</h2><p class="p">State WC acts typically cover accidental personal injuries that are typically defined as:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">an accidental injury that arises out of and in the course of employment;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">an injury caused by the willful or negligent act of a third person in connection with a covered employee's employment;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">a disease or illness that naturally results from an accidental injury, such as frostbite or sunstroke; or</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">an occupational disease. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The act does not cover injuries that are intentionally self-inflicted, as a result of the covered employee's attempt to injure another or any other willful misconduct, or resulting solely from intoxication on duty, including illegal drug use.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="ann1672727995440__section_N10076_N1004C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Does WC include injuries to while commuting to work?</h2><p class="p">Generally, employees are not covered while commuting to work, yet there are some exceptions. WC would cover an injury that occurred when an employee was traveling to and from one of the employer's places of business to another during the workday, or if the employee were to be exposed to a hazardous substance, usually not exposed to the general public, when traveling to the employer's place of business. Only if the employee is injured on a distinct departure from work on a personal errand will there be no coverage.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="ann1672727995440__section_N10080_N1004C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Does WC cover business travel for the employer?</h2><p class="p">Generally, yes. Even if the employee is on a business trip yet is not specifically engaged in work at the time of the injury, for instance, a hotel bathroom fall, choking on a meal, or suffering a criminal assault, they are usually covered by WC.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ann1672727995440__section_N1008A_N1004C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Is the definition of <span class="q">“disabled”</span> as used for WC purposes defined the same as under the ADA?</h2><p class="p">While the meaning of disabled is not the same for these two acts, employers should be aware that the possibility that an injured employee might qualify as disabled under the ADA. If this is the case, taking adverse employment action or failing to provide reasonable accommodation for the employee could constitute illegal discrimination.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ann1672727995440__section_N10098_N1004C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Are WC payments tax deductible?</h2><p class="p">WC premiums are deductible by the employer for federal income tax purposes. Benefits paid to an employee are exempt from income tax.</p>
<p class="p">Can the employer fire an employee for excessive absenteeism where the employee is out on an injury covered by WC?</p>
<p class="p">In most states, it is allowable to fire an employee based on extended absences for a compensable injury. However, it is important to understand that firing an employee who is out on work on a work-related disability could create potential problems; if an employee were to be fired on this basis, the employee is then able to claim that the termination was abusive or in retaliation for having filed a WC claim. Further, in some cases, the employee may even be entitled to an FMLA leave, or reasonable accommodation under the ADA, in which case legal complications may arise.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ann1672727995440__section_N100A8_N1004C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Can the employee file suit against his or her own employer for work-related injuries?</h2><p class="p">The act prohibits that an employee sue his or her own employer, yet the act does not prohibit an employee from suing a third party who may have caused the injury. For instance, say an employee is in the employer's truck that is being driven by another employee in the course of delivery. If the truck were to get in an accident because another vehicle ran a red light, the injured employee-passenger may indeed sue the driver of the other vehicle. It is important to become aware of your own state's WC regulations with regard to third party suits.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ann1672727995440__section_N100B2_N1004C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">What if my company operates in more than one state?</h2><p class="p">A company that operates in multiple states must adjust their workers' compensation policies according to the local rules. If legal problems happen to arise, it is necessary to retain lawyers licensed to practice in the state in which the problem occurs.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ann1672727995440__section_N100BC_N1004C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">What do I do if I suspect fraudulent claims?</h2><p class="p">Currently, the number of fraudulent WC claims throughout the US is on the rise and therefore so are the overall costs for WC insurance. If an employer suspects fraud and has reasonable grounds for their suspicions, they should immediately call the appropriate state authorities. Employers should be on the lookout for signs of possible fraud, and should review claims of employees who:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Are new on the job; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Report injuries immediately before a layoff, strike, or shutdown; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Report injuries on a Monday morning, when there are no wit­nesses; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Have a spotty work history; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Are difficult to contact by telephone or other means; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Frequently change care-providers.</span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="ann1672727995440__section_N100E1_N1004C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">How are the benefit rates calculated?</h2><p class="p">The specific amount of disability benefits is calculated based on state maximums and minimums,
            and the employee's average weekly wage. For <span class="ph em">temporary or permanent
               total disability</span>, an employee may get up to two-thirds of the average weekly
            wage, with further stipulations and time requirements regarding the duration and
            condition of the disability.</p>
