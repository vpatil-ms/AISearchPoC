      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Pay Raises</h2><p class="p">Employers choose to offer pay increases for a number of reasons, including merit, seniority, skill/knowledge enhancements, cost of living adjustments, and efforts to ensure internal and external equity.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Merit Increase:</h2><p class="p">A merit increase is a pay raise that results from the employee's satisfactory performance. Typically, a merit increase is based on an employee's performance review and has an effect on his or her base pay. Some employees have come to see the merit increase as an entitlement. This can occur when similar pay increases are given across the board, regardless of performance. For merit increases to be effective, standards for reviewing and rewarding performance should be clearly defined, and supervisors should be held accountable for following established standards.</p>
<p class="p">When determining the amount of a merit increase, many employers factor in the employee's position within the pay range. For example, an employee near the top of the pay range may receive a smaller increase than if he or she had been near the bottom of the pay range. Merit increases are typically anywhere between 2% and 5% of an employee's base pay.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Cost of Living Adjustments:</h2><p class="p">A cost of living adjustment is a pay raise that results from an increase in consumer prices. These are more prevalent in the public sector than in the private sector and are typically given to all employees.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Skills/Knowledge Improvement:</h2><p class="p">Some employers grant raises to employees who improve upon their job-related knowledge and skills. These are sometimes called competency-based raises. For example, some employers provide a one-time increase to employees who earn certification in their field.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Budgeting for Pay Raises and Promotions:</h2><p class="p">To help determine how much to budget for pay raises, multiply your year-end payroll by the projected annual pay rate increase. Thus, a company with an annual payroll of $1,000,000 and an average pay increase of 3.5% should consider budgeting $35,000 for pay raises in the coming year.</p>
<p class="p">To determine how to distribute the increase across the workforce, many employers design a matrix that takes into account variables such as one's performance rating and position in the salary range. Others take advantage of market pricing or simply use a level rate increase across all employees deemed to be satisfactory or above average performers.</p>
