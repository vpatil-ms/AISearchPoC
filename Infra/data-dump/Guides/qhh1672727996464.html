      <p class="p">OSHA enforces its regulations by inspecting workplaces, issuing citations, and imposing
         monetary penalties for violations. Federal OSHA compliance officers will not normally make
         inspections unless there is due cause, such as a referral by an employee. However, local
         OSHA representatives can, and do, make unannounced inspections.</p>

      <p class="p">When scheduling OSHA inspections, the administration's priorities are as follows:</p>

      <ul class="ul" id="qhh1672727996464__ul_h5w_hpw_cwb">
         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Investigations of imminent dangers.</span> OSHA
            inspectors will come when there are any conditions or practices that could reasonably be
            expected to cause death or serious physical harm to employees, either immediately or
            before enforcement action can be taken. If a compliance officer finds an imminent danger
            situation, he or she will ask the employer to voluntarily stop the hazard and remove
            endangered employees from exposure.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Investigations of fatalities and
               catastrophes.</span> These are any work-related incidents that result in an employee's
            death or the in-patient hospitalization of three or more employees. Such incidents must
            be reported to the nearest OSHA office by telephone or in person within eight (8) hours
            of the incident. OSHA investigates to determine the cause of these accidents and whether
            existing OSHA standards were violated.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Investigations of complaints.</span> Complaints
            regarding a workplace hazard can come from any source. All employees have the right to
            request an OSHA inspection when there is reason to believe there is imminent danger due
            to a hazard or a violation of an OSHA standard. If requested, OSHA will maintain
            confidentiality, and will inform the employee of subsequent action taken.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Inspections that are programmed.</span> These
            inspections are regularly scheduled in <span class="q">“high hazard”</span> industries.
            Some small businesses and companies in low hazard industries are exempt from programmed
            inspections.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <section class="section" id="qhh1672727996464__section_N10060_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Inspection procedures:</h2><p class="p">OSHA compliance officers will familiarize themselves with any relevant facts prior to the visit, such as the employer's inspection history, the nature of the business, and the particular standards that might apply.</p>
<p class="p">An inspection begins when the OSHA compliance officer arrives at the establishment. The inspector will explain the purpose of the visit, the scope of inspection as well as procedures for the walkthrough of the worksite. OSHA welcomes, but does not require, that there be an employee representative for each inspection. It is beneficial for the individual(s) who are most knowledgeable about company safety measures to accompany the OSHA officer; however, the compliance officer may interview employees privately during the course of the inspection.</p>
<p class="p">OSHA compliance officers observe safety and health conditions and practices by performing the following tasks:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Consulting with employees privately, if necessary; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Taking photos, videotapes, and instrument readings; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Examining posting and records; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Collecting air samples; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Measuring noise levels; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Surveying existing engineering controls; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Monitoring employee exposure to toxic fumes, gases, and dust </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Requesting a copy of the employer's Hazard Communication Program</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The OSHA officer will point out any unsafe or unhealthful working conditions and discuss possible corrective action. Some violations can be corrected immediately. In these circumstances, the compliance officer records such corrections to help in judging the employer's good faith in compliance. Although corrected, the violations will serve as the basis for a citation and, if appropriate, a notice of proposed penalty. However, the penalties may be reduced.</p>
<p class="p"> When the walkthrough is complete, the compliance officer will give the employer
            and other involved parties a copy of <cite class="cite">Employer Rights and Responsibilities
               Following an OSHA Inspection</cite>. The compliance officer reviews all unsafe or
            unhealthful conditions and indicates apparent violations for which he or she may issue
            or recommend a citation and a proposed penalty. The OSHA inspector will not indicate any
            specific proposed penalties, but will inform the employer of their appeal rights. The
            employer may wish to produce records to show compliance efforts and information to help
            OSHA determine the time needed to abate an alleged violation. </p>
