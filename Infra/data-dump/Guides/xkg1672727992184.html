<p class="p">For the employee's portion of the premium payment, the employer may require the payment be made to the employer or to the insurance carrier, but no additional charges may be added for administrative expenses. The employer must provide the employee with advance written notice of the terms and conditions under which these payments must be made.</p>
<p class="p">The obligation to maintain health insurance coverage ceases if an employee's premium payment is more than 30 days late, absent an established employer policy providing a longer grace period. In order to drop the coverage, the employer must provide written notice to the employee that the payment has not been received and that coverage will terminate on a specified date unless the payment is received by that date. The notice must be mailed to the employee at least 15 days before coverage is scheduled to cease.</p>
