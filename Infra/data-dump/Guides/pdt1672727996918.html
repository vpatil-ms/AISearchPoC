      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">OSHA Violations and Penalties</h2><p class="p">OSHA violations and penalties typically follow when OSHA compliance officers find that employers violated one or more of the OSH Act's requirements. Citations are issued and penalties are determined based on the size of the employer as well as the employer's history of offense.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Citations:</h2><p class="p">If after an inspection, an OSHA compliance officer believes that OSHA requirements have been violated, the officer issues a citation. Citations charge the company with a particular violation, set a time for abatement or correction of the condition, notify the company of its proposed penalties, and provide information regarding the procedure for contesting the charges, should the company elect to do so.</p>
<p class="p">Citations are issued only to employers, regardless of whether the violation may have been caused or committed by an employee. When an employer receives a citation, he or she has the option of correcting the violations and paying the penalties, negotiating with OSHA to have the citation or penalties amended or withdrawn, or contesting the citation before the OSHA Review Commission. It is OSHA's policy to attempt to settle small cases, reserving litigation for the most significant infractions. In the meantime, employers must post a copy of each citation at, or near, the place a violation occurred for three (3) days or until the violation is abated, whichever is longer.</p>
<p class="p">Upon the employer's request, the area OSHA director will hold an informal conference. The purpose of the conference is to discuss any issues raised by an inspection, citation, notice of proposed penalty, or notice of intention to contest, in the hope of resolving the matter without litigation. To reach settlement agreement, the area director has the authority to modify penalties, abatement actions and dates, and characterizations of violations (i.e.: willful, serious, etc.). If no settlement can be made, the administrative litigation process will begin.</p>
<p class="p">If an employer chooses to agree with the citation and notification of penalty, compliance with abatement requirements and the proposed penalty set by the OSHA officer must be met within the stated period found on the citation. Extensions for compliance, however, may be requested through a petition.</p>
<p class="p">If the employer decides to contest the citation, it must do so in writing within 15 business days following notification. A letter to contest a citation, also known as a <span class="q">“Notice of Contest,”</span> must include the cited regulation that the employer was alleged to have violated, the proposed penalty, and the compliance deadline given by the OSHA officer. There is no special form for contesting a citation and no specified language that must be used. It is important to inform OSHA of each part of the citation that is contested. Any relevant part that is not contested will become final after the 15-day period has ended.</p>
