<p class="p">If an employee gives explicit notice of their intention to not return to work, the employer's obligations to maintain health benefits (subject to COBRA requirements) and to restore the employee to his or her position cease. However, these obligations continue if an employee indicates he or she may be unable to return to work but expresses a continuing desire to do so.</p>

      <section class="section" id="mri1672727994087__section_N1005F_N10048_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Job Reinstatement:</h2><p class="p">Upon return from FMLA leave, an employee must be restored to his or her original job, or to an <span class="q">“equivalent”</span> job (virtually identical to the original job in pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment). An employee's use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that the employee earned or was entitled to before using (but not necessarily during) FMLA leave.</p>

      <section class="section" id="mri1672727994087__section_N1006D_N10048_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><span class="q">“Key”</span> Employee Exception:</h2><p class="p">Under limited circumstances where job restoration will cause <span class="q">“substantial and grievous economic injury”</span> to its operations, an employer may refuse to reinstate certain highly-paid <span class="q">“key”</span> employees. A key employee is a salaried employee who is in the highest paid 10 percent of the employer's workforce within 75 miles of his or her worksite.</p>
<p class="p">In order for this exception to apply, the employer must notify the employee in writing of his/her status as a <span class="q">“key”</span> employee (as defined by the FMLA), the reasons for denying job restoration, and provide the employee a reasonable opportunity to make a written request to return to work after the employer's notification.</p>
