But motivating employees isn't always easy, especially since they aren't all motivated by the same thing. Supervisors should understand individual motivators and tailor their management style accordingly.</p>
<p class="p">Provide supervisors with specific standards so that they can determine what reward is appropriate based on specific performance outcomes. A common misconception is that all employees are motivated predominately by money. While this may be true for some employees, many are also motivated by other non-monetary factors, such as autonomy, challenging work, and recognition. Consider these cost-effective options:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Challenging work. Many employees seek challenging and varied work that allows them to grow and develop their skills. Not only does this foster a sense of achievement, but it can also help prepare them for future growth within your business. Whenever possible, try to design jobs with a variety of tasks and give employees <span class="q">“stretch”</span> assignments.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Recognition. Recognizing employees' contributions and accomplishments can help demonstrate that you value and appreciate their work and can provide continued motivation for meeting and/or exceeding expectations. Send <span class="q">“thank you”</span> notes or emails to express your appreciation and make announcements in newsletters or group meetings to highlight employee achievements.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Autonomy. Many employees are motivated by having greater control over the way their jobs are accomplished. This can help them to feel more personal responsibility for outcomes and can establish a foundation of trust and respect. Set clear goals and expectations but be open and flexible to how the results are achieved.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Teamwork. Some employees are motivated by developing strong working relationships with their co-workers. As an added benefit, camaraderie often results in a more relaxed and comfortable workplace, which can lead to a happier and more productive workforce. Consider assigning more group projects and facilitating group activities and company events.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Career development. Giving employees opportunities to learn new skills and face new challenges can be an effective motivational tool. Not to mention, career development can be viewed as an investment, since these initiatives can prepare employees for future growth within the company. Consider developing your employees through programs such as mentoring, coaching, job shadowing, and cross-training.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Flexibility. Flexible work arrangements can help motivate employees by allowing them to balance their work and life responsibilities. Rearrange work schedules for increased work-life balance. Consider telecommuting (work from home arrangements), compressed workweeks (e.g., four 10-hour workdays per week), and flextime (early arrival or departure).</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Time off. Paid time off serves as another way for employees to meet their work-life demands. It's also important for ensuring your employees have time to relax, avoid burn out, and remain energized throughout the year. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Motivated employees not only perform at a higher level, but they also tend to be more committed and have lower turnover. Determine what motivates your employees and then develop strategies accordingly.</p>
