      <p class="p">Employers must keep accurate records of non-exempt employees' work hours to comply with federal, state and local laws. This seemingly straightforward process can become complex when employees start work early or leave late, travel for business, participate in company trainings, and use mobile devices to remain connected to work after-hours. Here are some do's and don'ts to help you manage your timekeeping responsibilities.</p>

      <section class="section" id="nrt1672727997710__section_N1004F_N10048_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Do:</h2><ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Use an accurate timekeeping system.</span>
               Employers may choose their preferred timekeeping method (such as time clocks,
               timesheets or badge readers), provided it is complete and accurate. While it is a
               best practice to track employees' time to the minute worked, the federal Fair Labor
               Standards Act (FLSA) permits employers to round employees' hours to a maximum of 15
               minutes. Your time rounding policy must be applied fairly and cannot consistently
               round in the company's favor or result in the failure to count all of the time
               employees have actually worked. For example, if an employer rounds to the nearest 15
               minutes, they may round down employee time from one to seven minutes, but they must
               round up time from eight to fourteen minutes.<div class="note note" id="nrt1672727997710__note_q45_z33_jxb"> 
                  <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Some states place additional limits on time rounding. For
                     instance, the California Supreme Court recently ruled that employers are
                     prohibited from using rounding practices when tracking whether meal periods are
                     provided in compliance with state requirements. Check all applicable laws and
                     consider consulting legal counsel before implementing a time rounding
                     policy.</p>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Require employees to record all time
                  worked.</span> Time spent using technology outside of the traditional workplace to
               respond to work email, access the company network, check phone messages, or perform
               other work tasks is generally considered compensable work time. Make sure non-exempt
               employees know they must report all time spent working, including time they spend
               checking work email outside of work hours. If employees can't use your regular
               timekeeping system to record after-hours work, instruct them on how to promptly and
               accurately report these hours.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Record nonproductive time that must be
                  paid, too.</span> Under the FLSA and many state laws, employers must pay employees
               for time actually spent working, and also for certain nonproductive time, such as
               time spent in training or traveling on business. Make sure you understand the rules
               on the nonproductive time that must be paid and instruct employees to record their
               time accordingly.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Consider rest breaks <span class="q">“work time.”</span></span> Under the FLSA, rest breaks of a short duration must
               generally be considered paid working time. The U.S. Department of Labor defines a
               rest break as any period lasting 20 minutes or less that the employee is allowed to
               spend away from work. The duration of the break is generally the sole factor used
               when determining whether pay is required, not the reason for the break (such as for a
               cigarette, coffee, snack or to make a personal phone call).<div class="note note" id="nrt1672727997710__note_xj2_cj3_jxb"> 
                  <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Under federal law, employers must provide reasonable break time
                     for non-exempt employees to express breast milk for their nursing child for one
                     year after the child's birth each time they need to do so. Federal law doesn't
                     require employers to compensate employees for these breaks. However, where
                     employers already provide compensated breaks, an employee who uses that break
                     time to express milk must be compensated in the same way that other employees
                     are compensated for break time. Some states and local jurisdictions do require
                     paid breaks for nursing employees regardless of whether the employer provides
                     other types breaks.</p>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Require employees to verify hours
                  worked.</span> At the end of each pay period, require employees to review their time
               records and verify that they are accurate. This can help you make corrections before
               running payroll and document that the employee has confirmed the accuracy of their
               time records. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="nrt1672727997710__section_N10083_N10048_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Don't:</h2><ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Withhold pay if employees fail to
                  submit/sign/confirm timesheet.</span> Under the FLSA and many state laws, an
               employer must pay employees for all hours worked on the next regularly scheduled
               payday, regardless of whether the employee adhered to the company's timekeeping
               procedures. If an employee fails to submit/sign/confirm a timesheet, ask the employee
               and their supervisor to immediately provide/confirm the hours worked and pay the
               employee accordingly.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Permit employees to work
                  off-the-clock.</span> Employers can't ask or allow non-exempt employees to work <span class="q">“off-the-clock.”</span> If you know or have reason to believe that work
               is being performed, the time must be counted as hours worked and therefore paid. Make
               sure you have a policy that expressly prohibits off-the-clock work and have controls
               in place to prevent it. Managers should also be trained on how to spot potential
               off-the-clock work and how to respond. For example, let's say a manager receives a
               project from an employee via email after the employee's normal work hours and the
               employee hasn't reported any additional time worked. In this case, the manager should
               investigate further to determine if the employee worked past 5 p.m. or if there is
               another explanation (e.g., the employee was done by 5 p.m. but scheduled the email to
               deliver after that time).</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Withhold pay for <span class="q">“unauthorized”</span> or <span class="q">“unscheduled”</span> work time.</span> Under
               federal law, employers must pay non-exempt employees for all reported and unreported
               work hours they know or have reason to believe have been performed. This is true even
               if the work wasn't authorized/scheduled in advance. In most cases, you may satisfy
               your obligation under federal law by providing reasonable time-reporting procedures
               and paying employees for all reported hours (state law may require additional
               actions). You may have a policy that requires employees to get permission before
               working overtime (or before starting work early/leaving late). If employees violate
               the policy, the employer may subject them to disciplinary action for failing to get
               approval in advance, but in no case may the employer withhold pay.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Make automatic deductions for meal
                  periods.</span> It's a best practice to require employees to clock out and back in
               for their meal periods. This can help ensure employees are paid for missed lunch
               breaks and account for times when employees return from lunch late. Time records
               should accurately reflect that the employee took a meal period, how long the meal
               period lasted, and the actual hours worked. In addition, some states have meal period
               recordkeeping requirements, and automatic deductions may violate these requirements.
               Check your state law for compliance.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Forget to address interrupted meal
                  periods.</span> Under the FLSA, for a meal period to be unpaid, it must generally be
               at least 30 minutes without interruption and the employee must be fully relieved of
               all duties for the purpose of eating regular meals (some states have additional
               requirements). If the employee's meal is interrupted (including requiring the
               employee to be available to work if needed during their meal period), the employee
               should either be paid for the full meal period or be allowed to continue their meal
               period for a full 30 minutes following the interruption. Instruct employees to report
               interrupted meal periods, so they can be paid for the time.<div class="note note" id="nrt1672727997710__note_pbv_zqw_txb"> 
                  <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>At least two states (California and Washington) require employers to provide
                     premium pay to employees for interrupted or otherwise noncompliant meal
                     periods.</p>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Neglect recordkeeping
                  responsibilities.</span> The FLSA requires employers to keep time cards and other
               records on which wage calculations are based for at least two years. Employers must
               also keep payroll records, including hours worked each day and total hours worked
               each workweek, for at least three years. Records required for federal tax purposes
               must be kept for at least four years. Check your state law for any additional
               recordkeeping requirements. </span></li>
