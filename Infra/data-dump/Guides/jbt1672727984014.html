However, small employers that choose to offer coverage can do so through the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).</p>
<p class="p">The SHOP marketplace is intended to give small businesses some of the advantages that large employers have historically experienced such as greater purchasing power, the ability to pool risk, and more choices among health plans. In addition, if you offer your employees coverage through the SHOP and meet other eligibility requirements, you may be able to claim the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit. The maximum tax credit is up to 50% of an eligible employer's premium expenses. The credit is a general business credit and is claimed on the eligible employer's annual income tax return. For tax years 2014 and beyond, eligible employers can only claim the credit for two consecutive years. IRS Form 8941 can be used by both small businesses and tax-exempt organizations to calculate the credit. A small business can then include the amount of the credit as part of the general business credit on its income tax return. <a class="xref" href="https://www.irs.gov/affordable-care-act/employers/small-business-health-care-tax-credit-and-the-shop-marketplace" target="_blank">Click here</a> for more information on the small business health insurance tax credit.</p>
