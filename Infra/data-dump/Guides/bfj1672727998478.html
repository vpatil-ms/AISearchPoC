About two million American workers are victims of workplace violence each year. Some workers are at greater risk than others, including employees who regularly exchange money with the public, deliver passengers, goods, or services, or work alone during the late night or early morning hours.</p>
<p class="p">OSHA has also published some suggestions for employers to protect their employees against workplace violence as well as some guidelines to adhere to following violence in the workplace.</p>
<p class="p">In regards to preventing workplace violence, OSHA suggests the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Develop a zero-tolerance policy toward workplace violence. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Establish a workplace violence prevention program or incorporate the information into an existing accident prevention program, employee handbook, or manual of standard operating procedures. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide safety education for employees so they know what conduct is not acceptable, what to do if they witness or are subjected to workplace violence, and how to protect themselves. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Secure the workplace: install video surveillance, extra lighting, or alarm systems, and minimize access by outsiders through identification badges, electronic keys, and guards.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">In regards to handling workplace violence incidences, OSHA has suggested the following guidelines:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Encourage employees to report and log all incidents and threats of workplace violence </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide prompt medical evaluation and treatment after the incident </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Inform victims of their legal right to prosecute perpetrators </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Investigate all incidents and threats </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Discuss circumstances with staff members and encourage employees to share information about ways to avoid similar situations in the future </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Offer stress debriefing sessions and post-traumatic counseling services to help workers recover from a violent incident. </span></li>

         </ul>
