      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">FLSA: Economic Reality Test</h2><p class="p"> By definition, independent contractors are self-employed. Therefore, these workers are not entitled to many of the protections afforded to employees in a typical employer-employee relationship. This includes eligibility for minimum wage and overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).</p>
<p class="p"> In October 2022, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) published a proposed rule that would change the test for determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and rescind and replace the current 2021 rule.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The DOL uses an <span class="q">“economic realities”</span> test to determine whether workers are covered by the FLSA and entitled to minimum wage, overtime, and other wage and hour rules. Prior to 2021, this test looked at the following factors, each carrying equal weight:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The alleged contractor's opportunities for profit and loss. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The amount of the alleged contractor's investment in facilities and equipment. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The permanency of the relationship. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The nature and degree of control by the principal. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The amount of initiative, judgment, or foresight in open market competition with others required for the contractor's success. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The extent to which the services rendered are an integral part of the principal's business. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The degree of independent business organization and operation. </span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">2021 Rule:</h2><p class="p">Toward the end of the Trump Administration, the DOL published a final rule (the 2021 rule) that sharpened the economic realities test into five distinct factors, including:</p>
<p class="p">Two <span class="q">“core factors”</span> that carry more weight in the analysis. These two factors are the nature and degree of the worker's control over the work, and the worker's opportunity for profit or loss based on initiative and/or investment.</p>
<p class="p">Three other factors serve as additional guideposts in the analysis: the amount of skill required for the work; the degree of permanence of the working relationship between the worker and the potential employer; and whether the work is part of an integrated unit of production.</p>
<p class="p">The Biden Administration tried to withdraw the 2021 rule, but a federal judge ultimately decided that the 2021 rule went into effect on March 8, 2021, as planned by the Trump Administration.</p>
