      <p class="p">The amount an individual receives for a week of unemployment, known as the weekly benefit
         amount, varies according to state law. Usually, the amount is equal to 50 percent or 60
         percent of the claimant's normal weekly earnings up to a maximum prescribed by state law.
         Benefits typically continue for 26 weeks. There is an initial waiting period in most states
         before benefits begin, usually one week.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wnr1672727983465__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Extended Benefits:</h2><p class="p">Extended benefits are provided through a federal-state unemployment compensation program that provides additional benefits to eligible individuals who have exhausted regular unemployment during a period of high unemployment in the state.</p>
<p class="p">If approved, the extended benefits provide unemployment compensation for up to an additional 13 weeks. Some states also have enacted a voluntary program to pay up to 7 additional weeks (20 weeks maximum) of extended benefits during periods of extremely high unemployment. The high unemployment rate threshold is determined by each state.</p>

This <span class="q">“able and available”</span> requirement applies only to the weeks of unemployment for which an individual claims unemployment benefits. State laws define <span class="q">“availability”</span> in different ways, and some states have special rules for students or those performing military reserve services. Generally speaking, an individual receiving unemployment compensation cannot turn down reasonable work and still continue to receive benefits.</p>
