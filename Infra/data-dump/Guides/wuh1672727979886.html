      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Covered Employers</h2><p class="p">COBRA generally applies to all private-sector group health plans maintained by employers that have at least 20 employees on more than 50 percent of their typical business days in the previous calendar year.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Determining Employee Count:</h2><p class="p">Both full- and part-time common law employees are counted to determine whether a plan is subject to COBRA. An employer may determine the number of its employees on a daily basis or a pay period basis. If an employer makes this determination on a daily basis, each part-time employee counts as a fraction of a full-time employee, with the fraction equal to the number of hours that the part-time employee worked divided by the hours an employee must work on a typical business day to be considered a full-time employee.</p>
<p class="p">Individuals who are not common law employees are not counted when determining employee count. This means that the following individuals are not included:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Self-employed individuals (within the meaning of <a class="xref" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/usc_sec_26_00000401----000-.html#c_1" target="_blank">IRC section 401(c)(1)</a>)</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Independent contractors (and their employees and independent contractors)</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Directors (in the case of a corporation)</span></li>

         </ul>
<div class="note note"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>These individuals may qualify as employees for other purposes and may be eligible for COBRA continuation coverage if they have coverage under a group health plan that is covered by COBRA.</p>
</div>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Multi-Employer Plans:</h2><p class="p">A group health plan that is a Multi-Employer Plan is considered a small-employer plan if each of the employers contributing to the plan for a calendar year normally employed fewer than 20 employees during the preceding calendar year.</p>
