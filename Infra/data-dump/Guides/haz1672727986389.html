      <p class="p">The following examples illustrate how to calculate overtime pay for non-exempt employees
         paid under various methods:</p>

      <section class="section" id="haz1672727986389__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Hourly Rate:</h2><p class="p">Example: An employee is paid $10.00 per hour and works 44 hours in a workweek. The employee is
            entitled to 1.5 times $10.00 (or $15.00) for each hour over 40.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">$400 for the first 40 hours </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">$15 x 4 ($60) for the four hours of overtime </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Total = $460</span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="haz1672727986389__section_N1005C_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Piece Rate:</h2><p class="p">To arrive at the regular rate of pay for an employee paid on a piece rate basis divide the total weekly earnings by the total number of hours worked in that week. The employee is entitled to an additional 1.5 times this regular rate for each hour over 40, plus his or her full piecework earnings.</p>
<p class="p">Example: An employee paid on a piecework basis works 45 hours in a week and earns $405. The
            regular rate of pay for that week is $405 divided by 45, or $9.00 per hour. The employee
            is also entitled to $4.50 (half the regular rate because the employee has already
            received the straight-time pay for those hours) for each hour over 40 – or an additional
            $22.50 for the 5 overtime hours - for a total of $427.50.</p>
<p class="p">Another way to compensate pieceworkers for overtime, if agreed to before the work is performed, is to pay 1.5 times the piece rate for each piece produced during the overtime hours. The piece rate must be the one actually paid during non-overtime hours and must be enough to yield at least the minimum wage per hour.</p>

      <section class="section" id="haz1672727986389__section_N1006C_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Salary (Fixed Workweek):</h2><p class="p">Non-exempt employees may be paid on a salary basis, as long as they receive at least the minimum wage per hour and overtime when due.</p>
<p class="p">When a non-exempt employee is hired with the understanding that his or her salary will cover a fixed number of hours worked, the regular rate of pay is determined by dividing the employee's salary (and certain other forms of compensation, including productivity bonuses) by the number of hours it is intended to compensate (for example, a 40-hour workweek). Note: Your state law may have different rules.</p>
<p class="p">Example: A non-exempt employee is hired to work a 45-hour workweek with a weekly salary of $405.
            In this instance, the employee's regular rate of pay is calculated by dividing the $405
            straight-time salary by 45 hours, resulting in a regular rate of $9.00 per hour. To
            calculate overtime pay, multiply the five hours worked over 40 by one-half the regular
            rate of pay (5 x $4.50 = $22.50).</p>

      <section class="section" id="haz1672727986389__section_N1007C_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Two or More Rates (by the same employer):</h2><p class="p">When an employee, in a single workweek, works two different jobs at different rates of pay for the same employer, the regular rate for that workweek is the weighted average of the two.</p>
<p class="p">Example: A non-exempt employee is employed by the same employer in two jobs. In one workweek, the
            employee works 10 hours in the job that pays an hourly wage of $10 and 40 hours in the
            job that pays an hourly wage of $20. To calculate overtime:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Calculate total straight-time pay: ($10 hourly rate x 10 hours) + ($20 hourly rate X 40 hours) = $900</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Calculate regular rate of pay: $900 straight-time pay divided by 50 hours worked = $18.00</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Calculate overtime premium pay: $18.00 regular rate of pay x .5 x 10 overtime hours = $90.00</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Total compensation for week: $900 straight-time pay + $90 overtime pay = $990</span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="haz1672727986389__section_N1009C_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Non-discretionary Bonus:</h2><p class="p">Employers who pay out non-discretionary bonuses (predetermined bonuses based on fulfilling certain criteria in an agreement) must include the bonus amount when determining a non-exempt employee's regular rate of pay.</p>
<p class="p">Example: A non-exempt employee is paid $10 per hour. In the applicable workweek, the employee
            works 50 hours and also receives a $100 non-discretionary productivity bonus.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Calculate total straight-time pay: ($10 hourly rate x 50 hours worked) + $100 bonus = $600</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Calculate regular rate of pay: $600 straight-time pay divided by 50 hours worked = $12</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Calculate overtime premium pay: $12 regular rate of pay x .5 x 10 overtime hours = $60</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Total compensation for week: $60 overtime pay + $600 straight-time pay = $660 </span></li>
