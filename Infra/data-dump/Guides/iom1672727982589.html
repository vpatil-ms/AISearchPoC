      <section class="section" id="iom1672727982589__section_khx_4fm_xwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">FMLA:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The FMLA requires covered employers to provide female employees with unpaid,
            job-protected leave for incapacity due to pregnancy, prenatal care, or their own serious
            health condition following the birth of their child. Eligible employees (mothers or
            fathers) may also use all or part of their FMLA leave entitlement to bond with their
            baby after childbirth or placement or for a child's serious health condition.</p>

      <section class="section" id="iom1672727982589__section_qlz_kfm_xwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">State requirements:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Several states have family leave laws that require employers to provide
            pregnancy-related leave or to provide a reasonable accommodation for pregnant employees,
            which may include a leave of absence. Check your state law to ensure compliance.</p>

      <section class="section" id="iom1672727982589__section_lxz_kfm_xwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC):</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The EEOC states that an employer is generally required to treat a pregnant worker the
            same as other employees who are similar in their ability or inability to work. This
            means that if an employer provides leave for other temporarily disabled employees, it
            may be required to provide leave to pregnant employees as well.</p>

      <section class="section" id="iom1672727982589__section_km1_lfm_xwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Americans with Disabilities Act:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">While a typical pregnancy won't qualify as a disability under the ADA, complications
            during or after pregnancy or childbirth may result in a disability requiring a
            reasonable accommodation, such as a leave of absence. Generally, employers are required
            to provide a reasonable accommodation, unless it would impose an undue hardship on the
            business. Engage in the interactive process (have a conversation) in a timely manner
            with the employee to determine if a leave of absence, or other accommodation is
            necessary.</p>
