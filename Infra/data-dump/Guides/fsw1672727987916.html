      <p class="p">Employers must comply with numerous requirements, including paperwork and
         notices, when hiring new employees. In addition to required new hire paperwork,
         documentation is recommended to help administer payroll, benefits, and other HR
         responsibilities. Here are some key forms to keep in mind:</p>

      <ul class="ul" id="fsw1672727987916__ul_al1_5yv_cwb">
         <li><span class="li">New hire reporting. Federal law requires that employers submit certain
            information to their state regarding each new hire within 20 days of the employee's
            start date, but several states have shorter timeframes. New hire reporting is included
            in many RUN Powered by ADP<sup>®</sup> packages. If you have to fulfill these
            responsibilities on your own, you have several options, such as submitting the new
            hire's W-4 or an equivalent form. Check your state's new hire reporting program for
            details. </span></li>

      </ul>

      <section class="section" id="fsw1672727987916__section_bdr_ply_txb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Required New Hire Paperwork</h2>
         
         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Form I-9.</span> An I-9 Form must be completed
               for each new hire to verify the individual's identity and that they are authorized to
               work in the United States. To complete Section 2 of the I-9, employees must present
               documents for this verification. The I-9 Form includes a List of Acceptable Documents
               (List A, List B, and List C). An employee must present one document from List A or
               one document from List B and one document from List C. <ul class="ul" id="fsw1672727987916__ul_bl1_5yv_cwb">
                  <li><span class="li">List A documents: establish both identity and employment
                     authorization </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">List B documents: establish identity only </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">List C documents: establish employment authorization only
                  </span></li>

               </ul>
<p class="p">Employers must generally inspect Section 2 documents in the
                  employee's physical presence. However, due to the pandemic, the U.S. Department of
                  Homeland Security (DHS) has offered employers some flexibility. Specifically, from
                  April 1, 2021 through April 30, 2022, the requirement that employers inspect the
                  I-9 documentation in-person applies only to those employees who physically report
                  to work at a company location on any regular, consistent, or predictable basis,
                  according to the DHS. If employees hired on or after April 1, 2021 work
                  exclusively in a remote setting due to COVID-19-related precautions, they are
                  temporarily exempt from the physical inspection requirements until they go back
                  into the workplace on a regular, consistent, or predictable basis, or the DHS
                  terminates the flexible option, whichever is earlier.</p>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Form W-4.</span> All new hires must complete
               a W-4 to determine the amount of federal income tax to withhold from their wages.
               Several states also require a tax withholding form. Employers should ensure that they
               are using the latest version of the form, which may change each year. If the employee
               has questions or asks for advice on how to complete a W-4, instruct them to speak
               with a tax advisor.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Notice of Coverage Options.</span> Under the
               Affordable Care Act (ACA), employers must provide a Notice of Coverage Options to all
               new hires within 14 days of their start date. This requirement applies even if the
               employer doesn't offer health insurance and/or the employee is not eligible for
               health insurance.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Wage and hour.</span> Under federal law,
               employers that use the tip credit must first notify tipped employees of: <ul class="ul" id="fsw1672727987916__ul_bpx_5xv_cwb">
                  <li><span class="li">The minimum cash wage that will be paid; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The tip credit amount, which cannot exceed the value of the
                     tips actually received by the employee; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">That all tips received by the tipped employee must be retained
                     by the employee except for a valid tip pooling arrangement limited to employees
                     who customarily and regularly receive tips.</span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">State and local notices.</span> Many states
               and local jurisdictions also require that employers provide specific notices to
               employees at the time of hire. These required notices may cover state disability
               insurance, state-run retirement programs, leave entitlements, harassment and
               discrimination, workers' compensation, unemployment, and other employment-related
               benefits and protections. Many states require employers to provide, in writing, the
               employer's business name, address, and telephone number; the employee's rate of pay
               and regular payday; and certain other information. Provide new hire notices in
               accordance with your state and local requirements.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Handbook acknowledgment. </span>After new
               hires are provided with a copy of your employee handbook, they should sign a form
               acknowledging that they have received and are responsible for complying with all
               company policies. Make sure you give employees enough time to read and ask questions
               about the handbook before they are required to sign the acknowledgment form. In
               addition, provide new hires with your policies related to preventing the spread of
               COVID-19, such as any mask and vaccination requirements.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Payroll authorizations.</span> If you offer
               direct deposit, provide new hires with a direct deposit authorization if they would
               like their pay deposited directly into their bank account each pay period. A payroll
               deduction authorization should also be provided for voluntary deductions, such as
               health insurance premiums and retirement savings plans.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Benefits information.</span> All new hires
               should receive information about the benefit programs you offer as well as any forms
               required to enroll.<div class="note note" id="fsw1672727987916__note_u5m_2my_txb"> 
                  <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employers with health benefit and/or retirement plans must provide a summary
                     plan description (SPD) to individuals when they become a participant in the
                     plan or a beneficiary under such a plan. New employees must receive a copy of
                     the SPD within 90 days after becoming covered by the plan.</p>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Emergency contact.</span> An emergency
               contact form lets you know who to contact in the case of an emergency. This form
               should be completed within the employee's first few days of work.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Receipt of company property.</span> If you
               provide your new hire with company property, such as a laptop, cell phone, or key,
               have the employee complete a receipt of company property form. This acknowledges that
               the employee has received the company property listed, that they will maintain it in
               good condition, and that they will return it upon separation from the company, or
               earlier if requested. </span></li>
