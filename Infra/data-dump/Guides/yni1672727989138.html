      <section class="section" id="yni1672727989138__section_xkp_myv_cwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Documents that Expire Soon:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Generally, if a supporting document contains an expiration date, you must re-verify
            employment eligibility on or before the date of expiration by completing Section 3 of
            the I-9 Form. During this re-verification process, you must accept whichever document(s)
            an employee chooses to present (as long as they are from the Form I-9's acceptable
            documents list), whether or not they are the same documents provided initially. If the
            employee is not able to provide proof of current employment eligibility, you cannot
            continue to employ them.</p>

         <p class="p">The following documents may NOT be subject to re-verification:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="yni1672727989138__ul_ogv_qyv_cwb">
            <li><span class="li">Expired U.S. passport or passport card; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Alien Registration Receipt Card/Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551); or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">List B document that has expired. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <div class="note note" id="yni1672727989138__note_pgv_qyv_cwb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Complete Section 3 of the employee's original Form I-9. If you already used Section 3
               for a previous re-verification or update, use Section 3 of a new Form I-9 and attach
               it to the employee's original I-9. You must also complete Section 3 of a new I-9 if
               the form you used for the previous verification is no longer valid.</p>

      <section class="section" id="yni1672727989138__section_vxs_myv_cwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Rehiring Employees:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">You may also be required to complete Section 3 when rehiring a former employee,
            depending on how much time has passed. If it's been less than three years since the
            employee initially completed the I-9 Form, you must re-verify their employment
            eligibility by completing this section of the Form. If the employee's original form of
            work authorization has expired, you will need to examine a document that reflects
            current employment eligibility and record the document title, number, and expiration
            date within this section. If more than three years have passed since the individual
            initially completed the I-9 Form, they must complete a new I-9.</p>

      <section class="section" id="yni1672727989138__section_umt_myv_cwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Data Changes:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Although not required, the USCIS recommends that you note name changes in Section 3 of
            the I-9 Form. Note: If you use E-Verify, the USCIS also recommends that you encourage
            your employees to record their legal name change with the Social Security Administration
            to avoid mismatches in E-Verify.</p>
