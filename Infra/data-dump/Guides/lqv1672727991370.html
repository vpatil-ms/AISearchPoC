      <p class="p">The ACA requires that states establish a Health Insurance Marketplace, also known as
            <span class="q">“Health Insurance Exchange”</span>, in order to facilitate the purchase of qualified
         health plans by individuals and small businesses. The Health Insurance Marketplace is
         intended to give small businesses some of the advantages that large employers have
         historically experienced such as greater purchasing power, the ability to pool risk, and
         more choices among health plans.</p>

      <section class="section" id="lqv1672727991370__section_N10047_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Small Business Health Options Program Marketplace:</h2><p class="p">The portion of the Health Insurance Marketplace that will be dedicated to small employers is called the Small Business Health Options Program or <span class="q">“SHOP”</span>. Small employers, those with 50 or fewer full-time and full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, can use their insurer/broker or the SHOP Marketplace to compare pricing and plans or offer coverage to their employees if they choose.</p>
<p class="p">There is a SHOP Marketplace in each state. However, most state Marketplaces are either federally run or are a federal-state partnership. Employers must have an office or employee work site within the SHOP's service area to use that particular SHOP.</p>
<p class="p">Visit <a class="xref" href="http://www.healthcare.gov/how-do-i-apply-for-coverage-in-the-shop-marketplace/" target="_blank">Healthcare.gov</a> for more information.</p>

However, states have the option to expand eligibility to employers with up to 100 employees.</p>

      <section class="section" id="lqv1672727991370__section_N1006C_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Marketplace Notification Requirement:</h2><p class="p">All employers, regardless of whether they provide health coverage, must provide new hires with a written notification about the Marketplace and their coverage options. The notification must be provided to each new hire no later than 14 days from his or her start date. For more information, see Notification Requirements.</p>
