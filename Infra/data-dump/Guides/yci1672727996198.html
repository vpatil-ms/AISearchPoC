      <p class="p">The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) provides a 100% COBRA subsidy for qualified employees and dependents who lose coverage as a result of an involuntary termination or a reduction in hours (assistance eligible individuals or AEIs). The ARPA also provides a special second election opportunity for AEIs who are still within their COBRA maximum period but who had not previously elected COBRA, as well as AEIs who previously elected COBRA but are no longer enrolled (for example, an individual who terminated coverage because they were unable to continue paying the premium).</p>
