      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Deductions from Pay</h2><p class="p">There are a few very limited circumstances in which deductions from pay are permitted under the FLSA. The circumstances in which pay deductions are permissible, as well as instances in which employers are not permitted to make deductions from employees' pay, are described below:</p>
<p class="p">Mandatory deductions:</p>
<p class="p">Some payroll deductions are required by law. These include deductions for federal, state, and local income tax withholdings. Additionally, when employers receive court-ordered wage garnishments, the amount indicated within the garnishment order must also be deducted from an employee's pay, up to the maximum permitted by law.</p>
<p class="p">Voluntary deductions:</p>
<p class="p">Voluntary deductions that are made at the employee's request, such as those for benefit contributions, union dues, and savings bond purchases, are permissible as long as the employer doesn't receive any benefit from the transaction. Premiums and related deductions may cut into the minimum wage as long as the employee freely consents to such deductions and the employer derives no gain from it.</p>
<p class="p">Loss or destruction of company property:</p>
<p class="p">When an employee destroys company property or fails to return it following termination, the employer's ability to recoup the loss through a payroll deduction is extremely limited and varies from state to state.</p>
<p class="p">The employer's rights in such a situation are similar to those of other creditors. The employer could terminate the employee and then file a civil suit to collect the money owed or simply write off the debt. If permitted by state law, the employer could also try cashing the employee's paycheck for him or her and ask for the money directly.</p>
<p class="p">Overpayment of wages:</p>
<p class="p">If an employer mistakenly overpays an employee, it is recommended that, before recouping the losses, the employer makes an agreement with the employee in writing. In addition, the deduction should be made at the same rate as the overpayments that occurred. State laws differ on this issue; check your state laws before seeking repayment.</p>
<p class="p">Exempt employees:</p>
<p class="p">Exempt employees do not need to be paid for any workweek in which they perform no work. If any work is performed within the workweek, employers typically must pay the exempt employee's full salary for that week. There are, however, a few circumstances in which employers may make deductions from an exempt employee's pay:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Absences due to personal reasons: Deductions may be made when the employee is absent from work for a full day or more for personal reasons other than sickness or disability. If an employee is absent for less than a day, he or she must be paid for the full day. If an employee has available paid time off (PTO) the deduction should first be made from their allotted PTO hours before deducting from their pay.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Sickness/disability: Deductions from an exempt employee's salary may also be made for absences of a full day or more due sickness or disability if the deduction is made under a bona fide plan, policy, or practice of providing compensation for loss of salary caused by both sickness and disability. Similarly, if the employer operates under a state or private sickness and disability insurance law, deductions may be made for a day or longer if benefits are provided under the particular law or plan.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"> While the employer may not deduct from an employee's pay for less than a days absence for sickness or disability, employers may deduct from an employee's allotted sick time under the company's leave plan in increments of less than a day.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave: Employers may dock the pay of exempt employees for family and medical leave-related absences of less than one full day without affecting their exempt status but only in situations where the employer is required to provide leave under the FMLA.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Penalties for safety infractions: Suspensions imposed in good faith for infractions of significant safety rules will not affect the employee's exempt status. Significant safety rules include only those relating to the prevention of serious danger to the company or other employees, such as rules prohibiting smoking in explosives plants, oil refineries, and coal mines.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">First and last week of employment: An exempt employee's salary may be docked during the first and last week of employment if the employee works less than a full workweek. Payment of a proportional amount for the time actually worked during these weeks is permitted.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Disciplinary suspensions: The pay of exempt employees may be docked when an employee is out on a disciplinary suspension of one or more full days. The suspension must be in good faith for infractions of workplace conduct rules. When suspending employees without pay, employers should point to a written policy that explains the infraction and the company's stance on the issue. The policy should be well communicated and should clearly describe the consequences for failing to comply.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Non-Exempt Employees: Deductions that cannot reduce pay below the minimum wage: </p>
<p class="p">The following deductions are permissible so long as the deduction does not bring the employee's pay below the minimum wage:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Cash shortages: To recover cash shortages from cashiers and other employees who handle money, employers must have a written agreement signed by the employee that authorizes the employer to make deductions when shortages are discovered. This is acceptable as long as doing so does not bring the employee's pay below the minimum wage. In the case of malice intent on the part of the employee, it may be possible to deduct the full amount of the shortage, even if it reduces the employees pay below the minimum wage. In doing so, the employer bears the burden of proving that the employee was personally and directly responsible for the shortage.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Personal use of company car: Employers may deduct the costs of an employee's personal use of a company car, but only if the employer does not benefit from such use and as long as the employee's pay does not fall below the minimum wage.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Uniforms: Under federal law, employers may deduct the cost of providing and maintaining employee uniforms as long as the deduction does not reduce wages below the minimum. In some cases, new employees are required to pay in advance for their uniforms. In such cases, the employee must be reimbursed no later than the first regular payday to the extent that these costs brought the employee's pay below the minimum wage. However, employers are not mandated to reimburse employees for required clothing that does not have a company logo and could be worn outside of work, such as khaki pants or a button down shirt.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Note: Some state laws prohibit employers from charging employees for uniforms or requiring employees to buy a uniform that has a company logo or can't be used as street wear.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Tools: Federal law permits employers to deduct the cost of providing <span class="q">“tools of the trade”</span> and other materials necessary for carrying out the employers business as long as the deductions do not reduce the employees pay below the minimum wage.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Note: State laws may differ on this issue. Some states prohibit an employer from requiring an employee to pay for job-related tools.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Non-Exempt Employees: Deductions that may reduce pay below the minimum wage:</p>
<p class="p">An employer may deduct the <span class="q">“reasonable cost”</span> of providing the following items even if the employee's cash wage drops below the minimum wage:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Federal, state, and local taxes: The required withholdings for federal, state, and local taxes, including FICA, may reduce wages below the minimum wage.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Meals &amp; lodging: Federal law allows employers to deduct the cost of providing food and lodging to employees as long as the employer doesn't profit from doing so, even if those deductions bring the employee's total pay to less than the minimum wage.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">State implications: Although most states also permit employers to deduct the cost of meals and lodging provided to employees, some require employees to voluntarily agree in writing to the deductions. Other states put a dollar limit on the amount an employer is able to deduct.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Fuel and merchandise: Fuel for residential heating and cooking and general merchandise provided by company stores may be credited against the minimum wage, but only if they are reasonably connected to provide board or lodging.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Transportation provided by the employer: This may be credited against the minimum wage, but only if the travel time does not count as time worked and is not necessary to the employer.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Instructional costs: Tuition furnished by a college to its student employees may be credited against the minimum wage.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Deductions that benefit the employee: This category includes deductions for life insurance, health insurance, pension, and welfare plans; contributions to charity; repayment of salary advances; and the purchase price of U.S. Savings Bonds. These deductions may cut into the minimum wage if the employee freely consents and if the employer derives no profit or benefit from the deductions.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Written authorizations:</p>
<p class="p">Before making deductions from employee pay, it is recommended that you obtain a signed authorization from the employee. The authorization form should include a specific listing of the deductions that the employee consents to, and if applicable, the amount. Authorization forms are most often used for deductions relating to health insurance premiums, credit union memberships, and voluntary charitable contributions.</p>
<p class="p">State implications:</p>
<p class="p">State laws are often stricter than federal laws, and requirements vary among states with regards to the circumstances that warrant a payroll deduction as well as how much can be deducted from an employee's pay. To the extent the state and local laws are more protective to employees than the FLSA, employers must comply with the more protective law.</p>
