      <p class="p">The EEO-1 Report is a form used by employers to provide the federal government with
         specific information on the number of employees they employ by race, ethnicity, and gender.
         Federal agencies use the reports to analyze employment patterns--such as the representation
         of female and minority workers within companies, industries, or regions—and to determine
         which federal contractors to select for compliance evaluations.</p>

      <p class="p">The EEO-1 Report must be filed by:</p>

      <ul class="ul" id="wju1672727998743__ul_yry_dtw_cwb">
         <li><span class="li">All private employers that are subject to Title VII and have 100 or more employees. </span></li>

         <li><span class="li">All federal contractors with 50 or more employees that (1) have either a contract,
            subcontract, or purchase order of $50,000 or more; (2) serve as a depository of
            government funds in any amount; or (3) are considered a financial institution that
            serves as issuing and paying agent of U.S. Savings Bonds and Savings Notes.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="p">The deadline for submitting the EEO-1 Report is September 30 each year. To complete the
         report each year, employers must use employment numbers from any pay period in July through
         September of that year. The EEOC prefers that employer submit EEO-1 Reports using the EEO-1
         Online Filing System or as an electronically transmitted data file.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wju1672727998743__section_N10058_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Self-Identification:</h2><p class="p">Self-identification is the preferred method of identifying the race and ethnic
            information necessary for the EEO-1 Report. Employers are required to attempt to allow
            employees to use self-identification to complete the EEO-1 report. The employer must
            accept the employee's self-identification by race and by ethnicity. Employment records
            and visual identification may be used <span class="ph">only if</span> an employee
            refuses to self-identify.</p>
<p class="p">Where records are maintained, they should be kept separately from the employee's basic personnel file or other records available to those responsible for personnel decisions.</p>
