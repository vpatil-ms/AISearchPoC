      <p class="p">With limited exceptions, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN)
         requires certain employers to provide 60 days advance written notice to employees prior to
         plant closings or mass layoffs.</p>

      <p class="p">A WARN notice is required when a business with 100 or more full-time workers (not counting
         workers who have less than six months on the job and workers who work fewer than 20 hours
         per week) is laying off at least 50 people at a single site of employment, or employs 100
         or more workers who work at least a combined 4,000 hours per week.</p>

      <div class="note note" id="klt1672727992637__note_dfp_cdw_cwb"> 
         <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employers should also check applicable state WARN laws, which may apply to smaller
            businesses and have more stringent notice requirements.</p>

      <section class="section" id="klt1672727992637__section_N10051_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Events that Trigger Federal WARN Notice Requirements:</h2><p class="p">Federal WARN is triggered when a covered employer:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Closes a facility or discontinues an operating unit permanently or temporarily, affecting at least 50 employees, not counting part-time workers, at a single site of employment. A plant closing also occurs when an employer closes an operating unit that has fewer than 50 workers but that closing also involves the layoff of enough other workers to make the total number of layoffs 50 or more;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Lays off 500 or more workers (not counting part-time workers) at a single site of employment during a 30-day period; or lays off 50-499 workers (not counting part-time workers), and these layoffs constitute 33% of the employer's total active workforce (not counting part-time workers) at the single site of employment;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Announces a temporary layoff of less than six months that meets either of the two criteria above and then decides to extend the layoff for more than six months; or</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Reduces the hours of work for 50 or more workers by 50% or more for each month in any six-month period. Thus, a plant closing or mass layoff need not be permanent to trigger WARN. </span></li>

The employer must also provide notice to the state dislocated worker unit and to the chief elected official of the unit of local government in which the employment site is located.</p>
<p class="p">Notice to individual employees must be written in clear and specific language that employees can easily understand and must contain at a minimum the following requirements:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A statement as to whether the planned action is expected to be permanent or temporary and, if the entire plant is to be closed, a statement to that effect;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The expected date when the plant closing or mass layoff will commence and the expected date when the individual employee will be separated;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An indication as to whether or not bumping rights exist; and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The name and telephone number of a company official to contact for further information. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The notice may also include additional information useful to employees, such as information on available dislocated worker assistance, and, if the planned action is expected to be temporary, the estimated duration, if known.</p>
