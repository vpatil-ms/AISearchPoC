      <p class="p">Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 503) prohibits federal contractors
         and subcontractors from discriminating in employment against individuals with disabilities,
         and requires these employers to take affirmative action to recruit, hire, promote, and
         retain these individuals. Section 503 applies to all employers with federal contracts or
         subcontracts that exceed $15,000.</p>

      <section class="section" id="hzq1672727989953__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Basic Requirements:</h2><p class="p">Under Section 503, covered contractors have the following responsibilities:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">EEO Clause in Contracts</span></p>
<p class="p">Among other things, contracts must state that the contractor will not discriminate against any qualified employee or applicant based on a physical or mental disability. The contractor must agree to take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment individuals with disabilities, and to treat qualified individuals with disabilities fairly in all employment practices. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&amp;node=41:1.2.3.1.10#se41.1.60_6741_15" target="_blank">41 CFR Sec. 60-741.5</a>.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Reasonable Accommodation</span></p>
<p class="p">Contractors must generally provide reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified applicant or employee with a disability unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the business. This requirement extends to the contractor's use of electronic or online job application systems. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&amp;node=41:1.2.3.1.10#se41.1.60_6741_121" target="_blank">41 CFR Sec. 60-741.21</a>.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Recordkeeping</span></p>
<p class="p">Contractors must keep any personnel or employment record for two years from the date the record is created or the personnel action is taken, whichever is later. However, contractors that have fewer than 150 employees or that do not have a government contract of at least $150,000 must keep such records for a period of one year. Certain records are subject to a three-year retention period. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&amp;node=41:1.2.3.1.10#se41.1.60_6741_180" target="_blank">41 CFR Sec. 60-741.80</a>.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Access to Records</span></p>
<p class="p">Contractors must permit the OFCCP access to their places of business for the purpose of conducting on-site compliance evaluations and investigations and inspecting and copying records. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&amp;node=41:1.2.3.1.10#se41.1.60_6741_181" target="_blank">41 CFR Sec. 60-741.81</a>.</p>
