      <p class="p">I-9 Forms must be kept on file for at least as long as is required by law. Employers are
         also subject to strict electronic recordkeeping requirements if they choose to retain the
         forms electronically.</p>

      <section class="section" id="voy1672727989604__section_csh_v1w_cwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Retention Period:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Completed I-9 Forms must be retained for three years following an employee's date of
            hire or for one year following their separation from the company, whichever is later.
            Only the pages of the I-9 Form on which you or the employee enter data must be
            retained.</p>

         <p class="p">It is a best practice to store all I-9 Forms together in one file since they must be
            produced promptly following an official request. You may retain completed I-9 Forms
            on-site or at an off-site storage facility, as long as you are able to present the forms
            within three days of an inspection request from an officer of the Department of Homeland
            Security, Office of Special Counsel, or U.S. Department of Labor. Note: I-9 Forms should
            never be kept in an employee's personnel file.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers are permitted to complete and retain I-9 Forms in electronic format, as long
            as certain procedures are followed. If you choose to keep electronic copies of the I-9
            Form, you must ensure the system includes:</p>
