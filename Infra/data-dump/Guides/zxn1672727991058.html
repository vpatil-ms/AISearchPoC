      <p class="p">The FLSA requires employers to pay non-exempt employees for all <span class="q">“hours worked.”</span>
         Depending on the circumstances, hours worked includes the time spent actually working and
         time spent on certain other activities, such as attending training sessions, traveling, and
         putting on or taking off required work gear (<span class="q">“donning and doffing”</span>).</p>

      <section class="section" id="zxn1672727991058__section_N1004B_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Training Time:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">In most cases, the FLSA requires employers to pay non-exempt employees for the time they
            spend in training. In order for training time to be considered unpaid, the training must
            meet all of the following criteria:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Attendance is voluntary and outside of the employee's regular working hours; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The course, lecture, or meeting is not directly related to the employee's job;
               and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee does not perform any productive work during such attendance.</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Example 1: A doctor's office requires employees to attend training on patient privacy.
            The training will take place at the end of the employees' regular shift.</p>

         <p class="p">Is pay required? Yes. The time spent attending the training must be paid because the
            training is not voluntary and is related to the employees' job.</p>

         <p class="p">Example 2: The owner of a health club is offering a yoga glass to clients and allows
            employees to attend. While the owner says attendance is voluntary, supervisors tell
            their employees that they are expected to attend and schedule employees' time off so
            they can do so.</p>

         <p class="p">Is pay required? Yes. Since supervisors make clear to all employees that their
            attendance is expected, and schedule employees' time off to facilitate attendance,
            attendance is not truly voluntary.</p>

      <section class="section" id="zxn1672727991058__section_N10078_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Travel Time:</h2><p class="p">Travel time may be considered hours worked depending on the type of travel involved. Here are some common travel scenarios:</p>
<p class="p">One-day assignment:</p>
<p class="p">If an employee regularly works at a fixed location in one city but is given a special one-day assignment in another city, the time spent traveling to and from that special one-day assignment is considered hours worked. However, you may subtract the time it normally takes the employee to travel to and from his or her regular worksite.</p>
<p class="p">Travel from jobsite to jobsite throughout the workday:</p>
<p class="p">The time employees spend traveling between job sites during the workday is part of their principal work activity and is considered hours worked.</p>
<p class="p">Overnight travel:</p>
<p class="p">Pay is required for the time that cuts across the employee's regular working hours (regardless of the day of the week). For example, if an employee's regular work hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday and the employee goes on an overnight business trip that begins with a 9 a.m. flight on a Saturday (a time the employee would normally be at work), the time on the flight is considered work time. Travel to and from the hotel and airport must also be paid if it falls during the employee's normal hours.</p>
<p class="p">Work Performed During the Commute:</p>
<p class="p">If an employer asks an employee to pick up office supplies or perform other work during their commute, the time the employee spends working and the time the employee spends traveling from the beginning of the first work-related duty to the work site (or home) would be considered hours worked.</p>
<p class="p">Travel for Remote Employees:</p>
<p class="p">If an employer requires telecommuters to come to the office periodically for meetings, those employees would be entitled to pay for the time spent traveling to and from the office.</p>
<p class="p">Callback Travel:</p>
<p class="p">If an employee who has gone home after completing a day's work is subsequently called back and must travel a substantial distance to perform an emergency job for one of the company's customers, all the time spent in travel (as well as the time spent performing job responsibilities once the employee arrives) is considered working time. Under the FLSA, there is generally no requirement to pay employees for time spent traveling when they are called back to their regular place of work outside normal work hours.</p>

            met (see <a class="xref" href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title29-vol3/pdf/CFR-2011-title29-vol3-sec778-318.pdf" target="_blank">29 CFR 778.318(b)</a>):</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The wage equals or exceeds the applicable minimum wage; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee has agreed to the separate wage in advance.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Because of the challenges of administering separate wage rates (including calculating overtime), many employers choose to pay employees the same wage for both productive and nonproductive hours. If you wish to establish separate rates, make sure you comply with all applicable laws and obtain a written agreement from the employee in advance.</p>

      <section class="section" id="zxn1672727991058__section_N100CD_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Donning and Doffing:</h2><p class="p">If safety and other gear is required by law, the employer, or the nature of the work, then the time an employee spends putting on and taking off gear on the employer's premises must be paid. The time must be paid only when the employer or the nature of the job mandates that it take place on the employer's premises.</p>
<p class="p">According to the Department of Labor (DOL), if employees have the option and ability to change at home, there is no requirement for the time to be paid, even if employees choose to change at work.</p>
