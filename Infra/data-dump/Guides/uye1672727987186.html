      <p class="p">Once an employer learns about an allegation of sexual harassment, whether the complaint is
         formal or informal, there is an obligation to investigate. The goal of the investigation is
         to gather the facts of the case and to determine whether sexual harassment has occurred. If
         the investigation reveals that harassment has in fact occurred, employers must take action
         to end the harassment and prevent its reoccurrence.</p>

      <p class="p">Because of the importance and sensitive nature of these types of investigations, the
         process should be handled with extreme care and legal counsel should be consulted as
         needed. The following are guidelines for conducting an effective sexual harassment
         investigation:</p>

      <ul class="ul" id="uye1672727987186__ul_kj2_mxv_cwb">
         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Investigate promptly.</span> The investigation
            should take place as soon as possible after discovering that harassment may have
            occurred. When possible, more than one individual should be involved in the
            investigation, including acting as a witness during interviews. Investigators should be
            instructed to remain objective and they must be trained on the investigative
            process.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Create a file.</span> To begin, create a
            confidential file to document the complaint as well as the steps you take throughout the
            investigation process. This file should be kept in a secure location separate from
            personnel files.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Take all complaints seriously.</span> It's
            important that employees feel comfortable reporting any instance in which they believe
            harassment has occurred. This can be undermined if employees believe their complaints
            won't be treated with the proper attention. As such, employers must take every complaint
            seriously and avoid any retaliatory action against complainants.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Prepare to interview appropriate parties.</span>
            Prior to beginning the investigation, determine who will be interviewed and prepare a
            list of questions. Arrange to conduct the interviews in a private location and plan on
            obtaining signed written statements from each interviewee attesting to the information
            provided during the interview.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Interview the accuser.</span> Those conducting
            the investigation should explain the investigation process, including their role as a
            neutral fact-finder. They should ask the complainant questions related to what happened,
            who was involved, when it happened, and how it has affected him or her. Other questions
            should address whether there were any witnesses or whether any other co-workers may have
            been subjected to the same or similar behavior. Take detailed notes and repeat them back
            to the complainant to ensure your understanding of the incident.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Interview witnesses.</span> Start by informing
            the witness that you are investigating possible misconduct and ask if they have
            witnessed or have been subjected to any inappropriate conduct. If they have information
            pertaining to the alleged incident, ask for the specifics of what they observed before,
            during, and after. Avoid unnecessarily disclosing information pertaining to the
            investigation and stress the importance of cooperating fully as well as your commitment
            to maintaining confidentiality.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Interview the accused.</span> Explain the
            accusations that have been made against the individual. Describe the investigation
            process and assure him or her that you are a neutral fact-finder and that no decision
            has yet been made with regard to the merits of the complaint. Ask the individual for his
            or her version of events and whether there are any witnesses or evidence that may
            corroborate it. Ensure that the individual provides a response to each of the
            complainant's allegations and advise the accused that retaliation against the
            complainant or any witnesses is forbidden.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Gather evidence.</span> If there is any evidence
            of the harassment, such as emails, instant messages, or video surveillance, it's
            important to take all necessary steps to protect it. Implement appropriate security
            measures to ensure that evidence isn't destroyed or tampered with.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Evaluate credibility.</span> Without a <span class="q">“smoking gun,”</span> the resolution of sexual harassment complaints often
            depends on the credibility of those involved in the investigation. Some things to
            consider when determining one's credibility include the consistency of the statements
            made, demeanor during the interviews, any corroborative or contradictory evidence as
            well as the individual's behavior immediately following the alleged incident.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Prepare the report.</span> When preparing the
            report, include a chronology of events, a list of witnesses, the facts of the case, any
            evidence you may have been able to obtain, and the conclusions you have made regarding
            the incident(s) in question. You may also want to include recommendations for preventing
            this type of behavior in the future and if you made a finding of harassment, any
            corrective action that will be taken against the responsible individual.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Take corrective action.</span> If the
            investigation reveals that sexual harassment occurred, take immediate and appropriate
            corrective action. The corrective measure may include training, job transfer,
            suspension, termination, or any other disciplinary action appropriate based on the
            severity of the conduct. When administering any type of corrective action, it's
            important to be consistent with how you have handled similar situations in the
            past.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Follow-up.</span> After you remediate the issue,
            it's important to check in with the victim occasionally to ensure the harassment has not
            resumed. If necessary, take further corrective action and update the written report with
            any new developments.</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="p">Effective investigation procedures can not only help to uncover inappropriate conduct, but
         they can also serve to document your good faith efforts to respond to accusations of
         wrongdoing. When done with the necessary care, these investigations can be a powerful tool
         for preventing sexual harassment and maintaining a safe and productive work environment.
         Remember that all claims of sexual harassment should be taken seriously and you should
         consult with legal counsel as needed.</p>

      <section class="section" id="uye1672727987186__section_N10084_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Maintaining an Investigation File:</h2><p class="p">When conducting an investigation it is important to create a file which includes information such as what actions were taken, who was involved, and all the communications. Here are some examples of things to include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A log of the investigator's actions and calls with dates and times </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Progressive and final interview notes for each witness </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">All communications to and from witnesses, including the alleged victims and the alleged harasser </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">All draft and final witness statements </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">All complaints </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">All documents (including tape recordings or other physical evidence) that support or refute the allegations of the complaint </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The investigator's report </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">All documents reflecting notification of the investigation results and any remedial action taken</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Remember, any notes of conversations or communications between your legal counsel and the company should be maintained in a separate file. In addition, the investigation file should not contain the investigator's opinions or conclusions, unless they're necessary for the final report or to assess the credibility of a witness.</p>
<p class="p">Sometimes an alleged harasser might wish to have a co-worker represent him or her. If the circumstances allow it, it is recommended to grant the employee's request. This can help give the accused employee a sense of fairness in the investigation. However, if this second individual is a witness or observer to the alleged harassment it is recommended that you see the two individuals separately so that you may focus on one perspective at a time.</p>

      <section class="section" id="uye1672727987186__section_N100B7_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">How to Conduct a Sexual Harassment Interview:</h2><p class="p">Interviewing anyone can be an intimidating task. Interviewing victims, alleged harassers and witnesses can be an even more challenging task. The topic is highly sensitive--emotions will run the gamut from nervousness and anger, to fear and feelings of violation. To complicate matters the facts and details of the case are extremely important and vital to obtain. As a result it important to take every measure possible to prepare yourself for these interviews.</p>
<p class="p">It is important to plan out before an interview begins what information you need to obtain from the individual you are interviewing. Also, try to anticipate some of the emotions that they might express. Close your eyes and visualize how you might handle the responses you could get from them. It may sound silly but it can be very helpful to preparing yourself.</p>
<p class="p">Be prepared, thorough and concise in your question asking. Remember to be as objective as possible and do not arrive at any conclusions until you have all the facts. Most importantly remember to stay calm, even the best trained manager would find a situation such as this difficult to handle.</p>
<p class="p">Always conduct each interview separately and as soon as is appropriate upon hearing of the case for the first time. When beginning each interview make sure that the employee feels comfortable with the investigator and the location of the interview.</p>
<p class="p">Explain to both the alleged victim and harasser the entire process that is being conducted, including how the final decision will be determined and when. Provide the employees with a copy of the company's sexual harassment policy and confirm the employee's receipt of the policies in the interview notes. In addition to providing a copy of your company's policies, make sure that the employees understand:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">That the company will not tolerate or condone improper conduct;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">That the company will conduct a prompt and thorough investigation to determine whether inappropriate conduct has occurred;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If the company determines that inappropriate conduct occurred, it will be stopped and appropriate corrective action will be taken;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">There will be no retaliation against the employee for bringing an honestly-believed complaint; and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee is expected to provide a thorough and truthful account of what has occurred and to identify all evidence and possible witnesses.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Caution: Don't promise the employee total confidentiality. You can, however, confirm that the information will only be shared with those who have a <span class="q">“need to know.”</span></span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">* Preface this information to the alleged harasser(s) that you are required to communicate this information regardless of whether or not they are innocent or not of the allegations. It is important to communicate this to try and limit defensiveness.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uye1672727987186__section_N100EE_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Information that should be obtained through the interviews includes:</h2><p class="p">A complete list of every act and statement the employee believes to have been instances of sexual harassment, offensive conduct, or that contributed to a hostile work environment. For each instance, be sure the accuser discloses the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">When, where, and what occurred, with as much detail as possible;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Who was present;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">What conversation and/or conduct occurred with the alleged harasser before the incident;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">How he or she responded to the alleged harasser when the conduct occurred;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">What he or she said to the alleged harasser the next time they saw each other;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Whether the employee ever did or said anything to the alleged harasser that would indicate that he or she had welcomed (or at least not been offended by) his or her behavior;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Whether he or she indicated that the act or statement offended him or her and, if so, how and when;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Whether he or she asked the alleged harasser to stop;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To whom did the employee first report the offensive conduct and whether or not he or she spoke with anyone else about this behavior; if so, ask who, when, and what was discussed;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Whether he or she made any notes, record or tape recordings of the conduct (if so, obtain a copy).</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Whether he or she continued normal activities after the incident, or if he or she sought any medical treatment or counseling as a result.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">You'll also want to inquire whether or not the complaining party was aware of your company's sexual harassment policy and complaint procedure and, if so, when he or she first become aware of it. Did he or she promptly use the complaint procedure? If not, find out why. What action does the employee wants the company to take? Does the employee believe he or she can continue to work with the alleged harasser and, if so, what the company can do to help him or her resume a positive working relationship with that individual?</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uye1672727987186__section_N1012A_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">More specifically, some important questions to ask the alleged victim include:</h2><ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">What is the name of the harasser? </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">What are the facts of the case? </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">How often did it occur? Is it still ongoing? </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Where did it occur? What are your perceptions of this behavior? </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Is there any physical evidence related to the case? </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Were there other employees present? </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Might anyone else have been harassed? </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Have you told anyone else about this behavior? </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">How would you like to see the situation resolved?* </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Is there any other pertinent information you would like to share with me?</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">* Sometimes the victim may simply want to be transferred or to have the alleged harasser warned. While you may often be able to grant the employees wish, to protect other employees and your organization it is necessary to stick with your company's stated policy for sexual harassment. For example, simply transferring the employee may not stop the behavior of the harasser and as a result, other employees may be at risk. This also increases the company's liability for not appropriately responding to such behaviors.</p>

<p class="p">You determine that:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Sexual harassment has occurred; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Sexual harassment has not occurred and the complaint was unfounded; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Based on your investigation, you cannot reach a decision. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Your actions will depend on the result of the investigation.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uye1672727987186__section_N101AE_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Sexual harassment has occurred:</h2><p class="p">If your investigation reveals that sexual harassment has occurred, you must take appropriate corrective action. The kind of appropriate corrective action will depend on the severity of the misconduct and the particular facts of the case, but it could include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Discharging or reprimanding the harasser; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Placing the harasser on suspension or probation; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Reinstating the victim with back pay; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Transferring or demoting the harasser; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Warning or disciplining all employees who failed to report the harassment.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Once you know that harassment has occurred, you have a legal obligation to prevent it from continuing and to remedy the situation for any other victims of the harasser. You must make any necessary follow-up to resolve the harassment and eliminate any of its lingering effects. If you don't discharge the harasser, you must take affirmative steps to prevent any future sexual harassment complaint.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uye1672727987186__section_N101D2_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Sexual harassment has not occurred:</h2><p class="p">Following your investigation, if you've determined that the allegation is without merit, you should thoroughly document why you believe that the allegation was unfounded and carefully organize your file. If the accuser files a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or with the courts, you'll have to prove that you met your legal obligations to the employee by conducting an impartial investigation. That's why it's crucial that you have a solid sexual harassment policy and that you maintain a complete paper trail documenting all action taken for each sexual harassment complaint.</p>
<p class="p">The simplest way to protect your company is to focus on the facts, treat the parties impartially, and act in good faith. Your investigative file should reflect on paper your fairness, objectivity, and impartiality.</p>
<p class="p">Because of the hostility that naturally arises from these types of allegations, it's prudent to separate the two employees from working together, if possible.</p>
<p class="p">CAUTION: Be particularly careful about disciplining an employee who makes an unfounded sexual harassment complaint. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from retaliating against an employee for making a sexual harassment complaint, even if it's unfounded. He or she can't be disciplined for making a good faith complaint, even if it's without merit.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uye1672727987186__section_N101E5_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Inconclusive investigation:</h2><p class="p">Either from a lack of evidence or uncooperative witnesses, sexual harassment investigators often can't reach a definitive conclusion of whether or not harassment has occurred. In this case, you should clearly document the investigation and spell out why you cannot come to a conclusion. Again, the employer may consider whether separating the two employees is an appropriate course of action.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uye1672727987186__section_N101EF_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Follow up:</h2><p class="p">After concluding the investigation, be sure to follow up with the alleged victim and the alleged harasser(s). The investigator should let the grieving party know the results of the investigation. Generally, you may tell him or her whether disciplinary action has been taken, but don't share details of the type of disciplinary action with him or her. Be sure to give the grieving party a chance to ask questions. Finally, the investigator should periodically check in with the employee to confirm that the harassment has not begun again and that he or she has not been subjected to retaliation. These <span class="q">“check-ins”</span> should occur in a private place, not in front of other employees.</p>
<p class="p">When you follow up with the alleged harasser, clearly explain the results of the investigation, review once again the company's policies and explain what disciplinary action, if any, is being taken against him or her and why. Give the alleged harasser a chance to ask any questions. Finally, be sure he or she understands any future harassing conduct will not be tolerated and that he or she is not to retaliate against the complaining party in any way.</p>
<p class="p">* Remember to document all steps that are taken in the investigation and in the follow-up process.</p>
