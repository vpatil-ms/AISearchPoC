Some of the following may be done in-house while others are legislative or administrative changes to the WC sys­tem:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Claims Management:</span> To prevent abuse of WC claims,
               employers should promptly report every WC claim to their insurance carrier, whether
               or not the validity of the claim is in question. The best approach to managing claims
               is to set up a systematic procedure for forwarding claims, delegating the
               responsibility to dependable individuals at both company head­quarters and branch
               offices. The employer should consider establish­ing a medical care management program
               for treatment of compens­able injuries and illnesses.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Managed Care Programs:</span> Some states allow employers to
               establish medical care manage­ment pro­grams for treatment of compens­able injuries
               and illnesses. Managed care in WC means the employer is affiliated with an
               organization for which health care providers work (usually an HMO) or that offers a
               list of physi­cians and other care providers (a PPO). This allows many of the
               managed-care techniques used to curb non-occupational group health costs to be
               applied to WC. Typically, employers are required to submit plans to their state's WC
               Commissioner for approval. Then, employers must seek medical care from providers
               listed in the plan. Employers with approved plans are usually required to post a
               notice to employees describing the plan and other related employee rights.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Accountability:</span> Establish a budget system that holds
               managers accountable for WC costs. </span></li>
