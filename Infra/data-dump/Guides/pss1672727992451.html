      <section class="section" id="pss1672727992451__section_N1003F_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Contract with Treatment Providers:</h2><p class="p">Take control of the medical process by affiliating with a clinic, hospital, or doctor.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pss1672727992451__section_N10049_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Immediate Action:</h2><p class="p">Studies have shown that the more quickly the employer gets involved in a WC claim, the sooner it is resolved. Take prompt action and stay involved.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pss1672727992451__section_N10053_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Job Classification:</h2><p class="p">Be sure employees are properly classified within their risk class. Improper rate classification can be costly.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pss1672727992451__section_N1005D_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Medical Treatment:</h2><p class="p">The employer will benefit by making the most thorough provisions for medi­cal treat­ment at time of injury and by doing everything possible to get employees back to work, even if they require fur­ther medical treatment on company time. Insurance carriers' premiums will eventually reflect all costs incurred because of injury; anything that can be done to hold down these costs will save the company money in the future.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pss1672727992451__section_N10067_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Morale:</h2><p class="p">Keep morale high. There is evidence that employees with morale problems are more likely to be injured. Since absenteeism and turnover are indicators of employee morale, it is important to monitor them.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pss1672727992451__section_N10071_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Payroll Calculations:</h2><p class="p">Make sure insurance premiums are based only on straight time, includ­ing the straight-time portion of overtime, vacation pay, and sick leave.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pss1672727992451__section_N1007B_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Pre-assignment Physical Exams:</h2><p class="p">Screen applicants for preexisting conditions and drug use. Be sure the examining physician is familiar with the physical demands of the individual's job assignments, and take the doctor's advice on relevant accommo­dations. (Keep in mind that the ADA prohibits pre-employment physicals unless the employer has already made an official conditional offer of employment to the applicant.)</p>

      <section class="section" id="pss1672727992451__section_N10085_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Safety Programs:</h2><p class="p">Reduce workplace hazards by establishing a safety committee of employees and management representatives to review the circumstances of workplace injuries and to recommend corrective mea­sures for any reported hazards. Be sure that safety rules are effectively communicated to employees and consistently enforced.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pss1672727992451__section_N1008F_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Small Claims:</h2><p class="p">By paying small claims from cash on hand, employers may avoid higher premiums later; however, employers may not neglect their accident reporting obligations.</p>
