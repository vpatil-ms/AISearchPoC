      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Information returns for all employers:</h2><p class="p">Certain employers must report health coverage to the IRS and furnish a statement about health coverage to their employees on an annual basis. Covered employers include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">All employers with 50 or more full-time and FTE employees</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers with less than 50 full-time and FTE employees that offer 1) a self-insured health plan (generally, a type of plan where the employer assumes the risk of paying participants' claims out of its general assets or a trust) or 2) a level-funded plan (generally, a type of self-insured plan where rates are based on group experience, with fixed monthly payments that are used to pay claims and maintain stop-loss coverage).</span></li>

         </ul>
<div class="note note"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>If you have fewer than 50 full-time and FTE employees and offer a fully insured health plan, your insurer is responsible for filing the required forms with the IRS and furnishing the forms to your employees.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">The returns must be completed using either <a class="xref" href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/About-Form-1095-B" target="_blank">Form 1095-B</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1094b.pdf?_ga=1.223177115.1864969174.1475754216" target="_blank">Form 1094-B</a> or <a class="xref" href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/About-Form-1095-C" target="_blank">Form 1095-C</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1094c.pdf?_ga=1.252988553.1864969174.1475754216" target="_blank">Form 1094-C</a>, depending on the size of your business and the type of coverage offered. A copy of Form 1095-B or Form 1095-C (or an appropriate substitute statement) must be provided to each employee by January 31. Each year covered employers must also file the forms with the IRS by February 28 (or March 31 if filed electronically).</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">What do these forms report?</h2><p class="p">Among other things, these forms report the name, address and Social Security Number of all individuals (employees, spouses, dependents, and others) who are covered under an employer's health plan and the number of months during which the individual had at least one day of coverage.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Why must they be filed?</h2><p class="p">These forms will assist the IRS in verifying, among other things, which individuals have coverage through their respective employers and whether the employer may be subject to a penalty under the Employer Mandate.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Requirements for small employers with self-insured (or level-funded) plan:</h2><p class="p">Generally, if you had fewer than 50 full-time and FTE employees in the previous calendar year and have a self-insured health plan (including a level-funded plan), you must complete and furnish Forms 1095-B to the enrolled individuals and file Forms 1095-B and Form 1094-B (transmittal) with the IRS.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Requirements for applicable large employers:</h2><p class="p">Employers with 50 or more full time and FTE employees must furnish <a class="xref" href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1095c.pdf" target="_blank">Form 1095-C</a> to full-time employees and file <a class="xref" href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1094c.pdf" target="_blank">Form 1094-C</a> (transmittal) and 1095-C annually with the IRS.</p>
