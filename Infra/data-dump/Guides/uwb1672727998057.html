      <p class="p">Businesses can implement a number of different procedures and programs in order to help
         ensure that its recruiting and hiring practices are acceptable as equal employment
         opportunities. First, they can use a number of recruitment sources that attract and support
         women and minorities through websites, university organizations, and community-based
         associations.</p>

      <p class="p">The U.S. Department of Labor has sample letters that can be sent to recruitment sources
         about the specifications and qualifications of job openings and invites them to refer
         qualified applicants for the job. These letters can be sent out prior to when the position
         needs to be filled so the sources have enough time to refer applicants. Maintaining a file
         of these letters and the responses also allows employers to have a list of recruitment
         sources to be invited to tour their locations and find out about the products and services
         and additional employment opportunities.</p>

<p class="p">The self-audits fall into three areas. Self-audits can:</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uwb1672727998057__section_N10054_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">1. Be conducted shortly before or after a company makes an employment decision.</h2><p class="p">These self-audits normally consist of a comparison of applicants and/or employees who are competing for, requesting to retain, or promoted to a specific job. This self-audit should be conducted as soon as possible after an employment decision is made for new candidates and regularly throughout the year. The audit will answer such questions as "Were there women and minority applicants for entry and company positions? What were their qualifications? How did their qualifications compare to the ones hired, retained or promoted? Why were these people hired, retained or advanced over the women and minority applicants who appeared to have comparable qualifications? Were all the qualifications necessary for successful performance of the job? From this information, companies can determine whether job qualification standards were consistently applied to all candidates and employees.</p>
<p class="p">Similarly, a company needs to look at its termination statistics. How were termination decisions made? Were the women and minorities terminated for offenses similar to those committed by non-minorities or men? Such questions will help determine whether standards are being applied equally to all employees and if minority and female employees are terminated in similar circumstances as non-minorities or male employees. Businesses should keep records of what was found by the self-audit. If there are any decisions that seem questionable and cannot be justified by legitimate factors, action should be taken to correct the problem(s). In addition, businesses should periodically offer supervisory training on how to avoid unlawful employment discrimination when making employment decisions and establish EEO performance as a standard for managers and supervisors.</p>

      <section class="section" id="uwb1672727998057__section_N10061_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">2. Determine where female and minority employees are or are not located in the organization.</h2><p class="p">Self-audits are also conducted to determine where female and minority workers are and are not located within an organization. For example, it is helpful for businesses to identify the gender, race, and ethnicity of each employee on an organizational chart. They can look for concentrations of female or minority employees, especially in lower-paying jobs; areas where female and minority employees seem to be absent or poorly represented, especially in higher-paying jobs; and the ways employees are promoted from lower- to higher-ranking jobs.</p>
<p class="p">Such a self-audit may make companies aware of potential problems that require further investigation, such as placing women in different jobs based on stereotypical beliefs about physical or intellectual qualifications or temperament. For example, a company has a number of openings for two entry-level jobs. One of the entry-level positions involves heavy lifting and pays more than the other one. The employer engages in sex-based discrimination when it hires only male applicants for the job involving heavy lifting and only female applicants for the other entry-level job. Normally, companies should audit those positions requiring the same qualifications and duties while having dissimilar rates of pay, promotional opportunity, access to training and better benefits.</p>

Analyze how the company's hiring processes over time have impacted women and minorities.</h2><p class="p">A statistical audit that looks at personnel decisions can determine how women and minorities have been impacted over a specific time period. This can be done by identifying the gender, race, and ethnicity of each employee over a time period.</p>
<p class="p">In general, jobs requiring the same qualifications and duties while having dissimilar rates of pay, promotional opportunity, access to training, better benefits/perks, etc., should be audited.</p>
