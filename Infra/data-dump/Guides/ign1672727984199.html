<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Include this notice in the employee handbook or other written materials concerning employee benefits or leave rights; or</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Distribute a copy of the notice to each employee upon hire if a handbook or other written material does not exist.</span></li>

      <section class="section" id="ign1672727984199__section_N10066_N10044_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Notice of Eligibility and Rights and Responsibilities:</h2><p class="p">When an employee requests FMLA leave, or when the employer acquires knowledge that an employee's leave may be for an FMLA-qualifying reason, the employer must provide the employee with Form WH 381 (Notice of Eligibility and Rights &amp; Responsibilities). This notice must be provided within five business days and include the following information:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Part A: The employer must indicate whether the employee is eligible for FMLA leave.
               If the employee is ineligible for FMLA leave, the employer must indicate why.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Part B: If the employee is eligible for leave, this portion of the form explains
               their rights and responsibilities while on leave.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">If an employee provides notice of a subsequent need for FMLA leave during the applicable 12-month period due to a different FMLA-qualifying reason, and there is no change to the employee's eligibility status, you are not required to provide an additional eligibility notice. If, however, the employee's eligibility status has changed, you must notify the employee within five business days, absent extenuating circumstances.</p>

This Designation Notice (Form WH-382) must be provided to the employee within five business days, absent extenuating circumstances. Among other things, the form must indicate whether the employee:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Must use their accrued paid leave during FMLA leave.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Will be required to present a fitness for duty certificate before returning to work. If this requirement extends to the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the job, you must attach a list of the employee's essential job functions. </span></li>
