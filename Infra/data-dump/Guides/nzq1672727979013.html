      <section class="section" id="nzq1672727979013__section_N1003F_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Eligibility Requirements</h2><p class="p">The FMLA covers all public employers as well as private employers with 50 or more employees for each working day during 20 or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year. Full-time, part-time, temporary, or even seasonal workers may be eligible for FMLA leave, as long as they are on the payroll and satisfy a three-prong test:</p>
<p class="p">Minimum Service Requirement: The employee has worked for the employer for at least 12 months (not necessarily consecutive) at the time the leave is to commence;</p>
<p class="p">Minimum Hours Requirement: The employee has worked for the employer for at least
            1,250 hours during the consecutive 12-month period before the leave begins; and</p>
<p class="p">Minimum Employee-Count Requirement: The employee works at a worksite that employs at least 50 employees at or within a 75-mile radius of that worksite.</p>
<p class="p">These eligibility requirements are explained in further detail below.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="nzq1672727979013__section_N10059_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Minimum-Service Requirement:</h2><p class="p">The minimum-service requirement is calculated as of the date leave begins, not the date leave is requested. If an employee requests leave before the eligibility criteria is met, the employer may have to project to when the date of leave is scheduled to begin to determine if the employee will be eligible for leave.</p>
<p class="p">The 12-month service requirement does not require consecutive months of service and includes periods of paid or unpaid leave (sick, vacation) during which other benefits or compensation are provided by the employer (workers' compensation, group health plan benefits, etc.).</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="nzq1672727979013__section_N10066_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Minimum-Hours Requirement:</h2><p class="p">The employee must work for the employer for at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period before the leave begins. Hours an employee was on vacation or on leave, even if the vacation or leave is paid, do not count as time actually worked and are not included in determining if an employee satisfies the 1,250-hour threshold.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="nzq1672727979013__section_N10070_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Minimum Employee-Count Requirement:</h2><p class="p">To satisfy this portion of the test, an employee must work at a location that has at least 50 employees at that site or within 75 miles of that worksite. This evaluation is made when the employee requests leave, not when the employee begins leave. Once an employee is determined eligible for leave, his or her eligibility is not affected by an employee count that drops below 50. To be counted toward the 50 employee size threshold, employees must be on the payroll for each working day during 20 or more calendar workweeks in either the current or the preceding calendar year.</p>
