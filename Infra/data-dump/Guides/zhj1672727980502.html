They may not treat employees or applicants less or more favorably due to their religious beliefs or practices. Also, employees cannot be forced to participate, or not to participate, in religious activity as an employment condition. Employers must also take steps to prevent religious harassment of their employees.</p>
<p class="p">Covered employers must provide reasonable accommodations for applicants' or employees' sincerely
            held religious beliefs, observances, or practices, unless doing so would impose an undue
            hardship. Undue hardship under Title VII is defined as <span class="ph em">more than de
               minimis</span> cost or burden.</p>
<p class="p">Examples of reasonable accommodations include flexible scheduling, use of the work facility for a religious observance, voluntary substitutions or swaps, job reassignments, and lateral transfers. Another example of a reasonable accommodation is providing an exception to a dress or grooming code, such as permitting a Muslim employee to wear a headscarf.</p>
<p class="p">For the purposes of Title VII, religion includes not only traditional, organized religions such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism, but also religious beliefs that are new, uncommon, not part of a formal church or sect, only subscribed to by a small number of people, or that seem illogical or unreasonable to others. An employee's belief or practice can be <span class="q">“religious”</span> under Title VII even if the employee is affiliated with a religious group that does not espouse or recognize that individual's belief or practice, or if few – or no – other people adhere to it. Title VII's protections also extend to those who are discriminated against or need an accommodation because they profess no religious beliefs.</p>

            <li><span class="li">Establish written objective criteria for evaluating candidates for hire or promotion and applying those criteria consistently to all candidates.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">In conducting job interviews, ask the same questions of all applicants for a particular job or category of job and inquiring about matters directly related to the position in question.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Carefully and timely recording the accurate business reasons for disciplinary or performance-related actions and sharing these reasons with the affected employees.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When management decisions require the exercise of subjective judgment, employers should provide training to inexperienced managers and encourage them to consult with more experienced managers or human resources personnel when addressing difficult issues.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">If an employer is confronted with customer biases, e.g., an adverse reaction to being served by an employee due to religious garb, the employer should consider engaging with and educating the customers regarding any misperceptions they may have and/or the equal employment opportunity laws.</p>
