      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Policies to Include</h2><p class="p">Some laws require employers to provide information to employees via a written policy. Policies are also important for communicating company expectations and requirements. Here are policies that are considered must-have.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">At-will employment</h2><p class="p">This statement reiterates that, absent certain exceptions such as an implied contract or public policy, either you or the employee can terminate the employment relationship at any time and for any reason, as long as the reason is a lawful one. It's a best practice to prominently display this statement in the beginning of your employee handbook (except in Montana, where at-will employment isn't recognized). Reinforce at-will status in your handbook acknowledgment form as well.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Anti-harassment</h2><p class="p">A growing number of jurisdictions are requiring employers to maintain a written policy on preventing harassment in the workplace. Keep in mind that your state or local law may require specific information to be included in the policy, such as how employees may file complaints with the state or local agency.</p>
<p class="p">Even if your jurisdiction doesn't require a written policy, it's a best practice to have one. In several additional jurisdictions, state and local agencies and/or case law recommends employers adopt a written anti-harassment policy.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Nondiscrimination</h2><p class="p">Federal, state, and local laws prohibit employers from discriminating against applicants and employees on the basis of certain protected characteristics, such as age, race, sex, and religion, among others. The list of protected characteristics and the list of covered individuals continues to grow as states and local jurisdictions enact new laws and government agencies and courts take new positions on existing laws. Some jurisdictions require a policy addressing discrimination. Even in the absence of a requirement, it's a best practice to have a policy that:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Includes all characteristics protected under federal, state, and/or local laws. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Addresses who is covered by the policy, such as applicants, employees, interns, and contractors (if applicable). </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prohibits retaliation against employees for filing a complaint or participating in an investigation. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Stresses that all employment decisions are based upon one's qualifications and capabilities to perform the essential functions of a particular job, without regard to protected characteristics. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Governs all aspects of employment, including but not limited to hiring, selection, training, benefits, promotions, compensation, discipline, and termination. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Urges employees to report all instances of discrimination and offers multiple avenues for them to do so. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">States that appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination, will be taken against any employee who violates the policy. </span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employment classifications</h2><p class="p">It's a best practice to clearly define employment classifications, such as full-time, part-time, exempt or non-exempt since an employee's classification can dictate eligibility for benefits and overtime pay.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Leave and time off benefits</h2><p class="p">These policies address company rules and procedures related to holidays, vacation, or leave required by law (such as sick leave, voting leave, family leave, and domestic violence leave). Several state and local jurisdictions recently enacted laws requiring leave for COVID-related reasons. Some leave laws may require a written policy. In general, these policies should cover who is eligible, what reasons qualify for leave, how much leave will be granted, how the leave will accrue and carryover (if applicable), whether the leave is paid or unpaid, how much notice employees must give before taking leave, continuation of benefits during leave, the procedures for requesting leave, recordkeeping and employer notice requirements, and reinstatement at the end of the leave. Check your state and local law to ensure all leave requirements are included in your employee handbook.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Meal and break periods</h2><p class="p">A policy on meal and break periods informs employees of the frequency and duration as well as any rules or restrictions related to break periods. Rest periods, lactation breaks, and meal periods must be provided in accordance with federal, state and local laws. Check back next week for our Tip of the Week on break periods.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Timekeeping and pay</h2><p class="p">A timekeeping policy informs employees of the method for recording time worked and the importance of accurately recording their time. With many employees working remotely and/or on flexible schedules, employers should ensure the policy meets their needs. Among other the things, the policy should direct non-exempt employees to record all of the time they work and expressly prohibit off-the clock work (however, if they do perform off-the clock work, you must pay them for this time). Require non-exempt employees to confirm their work hours at the end of each pay period and inform them that they should report any errors in their time record immediately. A policy on paydays should let employees know the frequency of paydays, the methods available for receiving pay, and any special procedures for when a payday falls on a holiday or when an employee is absent from work.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employee conduct, attendance, and punctuality</h2><p class="p">Attendance policies make it clear that employees must be ready to work at their scheduled start time each day and provide procedures for informing the company of an unscheduled absence or late arrival. It's also a best practice to have policies on standards of conduct, drug and alcohol abuse, disciplinary action, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, and workplace violence.</p>
<p class="p">Pay particular attention to your drug and alcohol policy in light of the evolving landscape regarding marijuana. Many states currently permit medical marijuana, and several states also permit recreational marijuana use. While none of these laws require employers to allow employees to use, possess, or be impaired by marijuana during work hours or in the workplace, some states have employment protections for employees who use marijuana outside of work. With this in mind, check your state and local law and work closely with legal counsel to review your policy and determine your rights and responsibilities.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reasonable accommodations</h2><p class="p">Under certain laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, employers must provide reasonable accommodations to qualified applicants and employees with a disability, or with sincerely held religious beliefs and practices, unless doing so would cause undue hardship. Some states have similar requirements that apply to smaller employers, and some states and local jurisdictions have laws that require accommodations in additional circumstances, such as when an employee has a pregnancy-related condition. Additionally, some of these laws require employers to have a written policy on reasonable accommodations, and it's a best practice to have a policy even if it isn't required.</p>
