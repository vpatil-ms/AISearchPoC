Generally, this is the same coverage that the qualified beneficiary had immediately before the qualifying event.</p>
<p class="p">A qualified beneficiary receiving COBRA continuation coverage must receive the same benefits, choices, and services that similarly situated non-COBRA qualified beneficiaries are currently receiving under the plan, such as the ability to choose among available coverage options during the open enrollment period. The qualified beneficiary is also subject to the same plan rules and limits that would apply to a similarly situated non-COBRA qualified beneficiary, such as co-payment requirements, deductibles, and coverage limits.</p>
