      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</h2><p class="p">Title I of the <a class="xref" href="https://www.hr411.com/kits/kit.php?id=31" target="_blank">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990</a> prohibits employers from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities in job application procedures, hiring, firing, advancement, compensation, job training, and other employment actions. The ADA covers employers with 15 or more employees, including state and local governments. It also applies to employment agencies and to labor organizations. The ADA's nondiscrimination standards apply to federal sector employees under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended, and its implementing rules. It is also unlawful to retaliate against an individual for opposing employment practices that discriminate based on disability or for filing a discrimination charge, testifying, or participating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under the ADA.</p>
<p class="p">An individual with a disability is a person who:</p>
<p class="p">Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities;</p>
<p class="p">Has a record of such an impairment; or</p>
<p class="p">Is regarded as having such an impairment.</p>
<p class="p">A qualified employee or applicant with a disability is <span class="q">“an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the job in question.”</span> Examples of reasonable accommodation may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Job restructuring, modifying work schedules, and reassignment to a vacant position</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Acquiring or modifying equipment or devices</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Adjusting or modifying examinations, training materials, or policies</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Providing qualified readers or interpreters</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Employers are required to provide a reasonable accommodation to qualified applicants or employees with a disability unless doing so would impose an <span class="q">“undue hardship”</span> on the operation of their business. Undue hardship is defined as <span class="q">“an action requiring significant difficulty or expense when considered in light of factors such as an employer's size, financial resources, and the nature and structure of its operation.”</span> That is, an employer is not required to lower quality or production standards to make an accommodation, nor obligated to provide personal use items such as glasses or hearing aids.</p>
<p class="p">Title I of the ADA also covers:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Medical Examinations and Inquiries: Employers may not ask job applicants about the existence, nature, or severity of a disability. Applicants may be asked about their ability to perform specific job functions. A job offer may be conditioned on the results of a medical examination, but only if the examination is required for all entering employees in similar jobs. Medical examinations of employees must be job-related and consistent with the employer's business needs.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Drug and Alcohol Abuse: Employees and applicants currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs are not covered by the ADA when an employer acts on the basis of such use. Tests for illegal drugs are not subject to the ADA's restrictions on medical examinations. Employers may hold illegal drug users and alcoholics to the same performance standards as other employees. </span></li>
