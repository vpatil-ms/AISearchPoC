<ul class="ul">
         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Maintain a written AAP.</span> Covered
               contractors must prepare and maintain a written affirmative action program at each
               establishment. This program may be integrated into or kept separate from other
               affirmative action programs. It must be reviewed and updated annually.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Make the AAP available. </span>The full
               affirmative action program must be available to any applicant or employee for
               inspection upon request. The location and hours during which program details may be
               obtained must be posted at each establishment.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Invite voluntary self-identification of
                  disability.</span> Covered contractors must invite applicants to voluntarily
               self-identify as an individual with a disability at the pre-offer stage of the hiring
               process and after receiving a job offer. Contractors must invite existing employees
               to voluntarily self-identify on a regular basis.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Adopt utilization goal.</span> The OFCCP has
               established a national seven percent utilization goal for the employment of qualified
               individuals with disabilities. The purpose of the goal is to establish a benchmark
               against which the contractor must measure the representation of individuals with
               disabilities in each of its job groups. Contractors must conduct an annual
               utilization analysis to compare the representation of individuals with disabilities
               in each job group to the seven percent utilization goal. However, contractors with
               100 or fewer employees may apply the goal to their workforce as a whole.</span></li>
