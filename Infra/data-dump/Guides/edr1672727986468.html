Typically an HRA is used in conjunction with a high deductible health plan (HDHP). An HRA is strictly employer-funded. Employers contribute a specified amount into an employee's HRA, and those funds are then used to reimburse employees for the costs of eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses. An employer sets up an HRA through a licensed insurance company or broker, and determines the amount available for an employee to be reimbursed, per coverage period, for eligible expenses.</p>

      <section class="section" id="edr1672727986468__section_N10049_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Health Savings Accounts (HSA):</h2><p class="p">A health savings account (HSA) is a tax advantaged way to save money to pay for healthcare. HSAs enable employees to pay for health-related expenses incurred before reaching an insurance deductible as well as qualified medical expenses not covered by their insurance plans. Similar to an HRA, an HSA is typically paired with an HDHP. Both employees and employers can make tax-deductible contributions annually to HSAs, in accordance with federal limitations. Employees may then withdraw money from their HSAs, tax-free to pay for qualified medical expenses.</p>

      <section class="section" id="edr1672727986468__section_N10053_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Cafeteria Plans:</h2><p class="p">Cafeteria plans are written plans maintained by an employer that meets specific requirements of
               <a class="xref" href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-05-42.pdf" target="_blank">Section 125</a> of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan provides
            employees the opportunity to contribute a certain amount of their earnings to a
            designated account or accounts on a pre-tax basis. Flexible spending accounts (FSAs) are
            a common type of account available under a cafeteria plan.</p>

      <section class="section" id="edr1672727986468__section_N10064_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Health Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA):</h2><p class="p">Health flexible spending accounts (Health FSAs) are employer-established benefit plans and may be offered in conjunction with other employer-provided benefits as part of a cafeteria plan. However, employees do not have to be covered under any other healthcare plan to participate. Health FSAs reimburse employees for qualified medical expenses and are typically funded through voluntary salary reduction agreements that are made on a pre-tax basis.</p>

      <section class="section" id="edr1672727986468__section_N1006E_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Dependent Care FSAs:</h2><p class="p">Dependent care flexible spending accounts allow an employee to set aside a specific amount of his or her pre-tax earnings to pay for eligible childcare expenses. Unless the plan provides otherwise, all funds in a dependent care FSA must be used during the tax year in which they are set aside, or they will be forfeited.
