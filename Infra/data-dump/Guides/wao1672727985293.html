      <p class="p">Absent undue hardship on the company, employers must provide a reasonable accommodation to
         an otherwise qualified individual with a disability. A reasonable accommodation is any
         modification or adjustment to a job or the work environment that will enable a qualified
         applicant or employee with a disability to participate in the application process or to
         perform the essential functions of the job. Reasonable accommodation also includes
         adjustments to assure that a qualified individual with a disability has employment rights
         and privileges equal to those without disabilities.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wao1672727985293__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Requests for Reasonable Accommodation:</h2><p class="p">Under the ADA, an employee or applicant doesn't need to use the words <span class="q">“reasonable accommodation”</span> for an employer to be on notice that a need for an accommodation exists. The individual only needs to notify you (orally or in writing) that he or she needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a disability. For example, <span class="q">“I'm having trouble getting to work on time because of medical treatments I'm undergoing,”</span> would be considered a request for a reasonable accommodation. If the initial communication is unclear, ask the individual if they are requesting a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="p">Once a request for reasonable accommodation has been made, the employer and the individual should engage in a dialogue, known as the interactive process, to clarify needs and identify the appropriate reasonable accommodation. The conversation should be limited to the nature of the issue generating the request, the individual's functional limitations, and alternative accommodations that may be effective in meeting the individual's needs.</p>
<p class="p">Generally, if there is more than one accommodation available, employers can consider alternative accommodations as long as the accommodation effectively removes the workplace barrier and allows the employee to perform the essential functions of the job.</p>

In these situations, employers may be required to provide a reasonable accommodation for a disability related to pregnancy, absent undue hardship.</p>
<div class="note note" id="wao1672727985293__note_N100A1_N10098_N1003C_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Some states have enacted laws that require employers to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnancy and childbirth, unless it would impose an undue hardship on the business. Pregnancy accommodations may include, but are not necessarily limited to, bathroom breaks, breaks for increased water intake, periodic rest, and assistance with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work schedules, and temporary transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wao1672727985293__section_N100A8_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Undue Hardship:</h2><p class="p">An employer is not required to make an accommodation if it would impose an <span class="q">“undue hardship”</span> on the business. Undue hardship means that an accommodation would be unduly costly, extensive, substantial or disruptive, or would fundamentally alter the nature or operation of the business. Among the factors to be considered in determining whether an accommodation would pose an undue hardship are the cost of the accommodation, company size, financial resources and the nature and structure of its operation.</p>
<p class="p">If a particular accommodation poses an undue hardship, the employer must try to identify an alternate accommodation. If cost causes the undue hardship, the employer must also consider whether funding for an accommodation is available from an outside source, such as a vocational rehabilitation agency, and if the cost of providing the accommodation can be offset by state or federal tax credits or deductions.</p>
