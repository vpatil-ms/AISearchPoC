      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Other Types of Leave</h2><p class="p">There are a number of other leave entitlements that may be available to employees at the state and local levels, including but not limited to:</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">School Activities/Small Necessities Leave:</h2><p class="p">Several states permit employees to take leave to tend to certain routine family matters, such as school activities or parent-teacher conferences. Generally, these laws provide eligible employees with a certain number of hours of leave annually, per month, or per school year.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Organ/Blood Donation/Bone Marrow Leave:</h2><p class="p">Many states allow employees to take leave to donate an organ, bone marrow, or blood. In some of these states, the leave must be paid and, in many cases, employees must provide advance notice of their need for leave as well as medical verification.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Crime Victim's and/or Domestic Violence Leave:</h2><p class="p">In some states, if an employee or his or her covered family member is a victim of a crime or domestic violence, he or she may be entitled to time off to attend legal and court proceedings, obtain an order of protection, seek medical treatment, or receive counseling services.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Emergency Response Leave:</h2><p class="p">In some states, employees who are volunteer firefighters or emergency rescue workers are entitled to leave in order to respond to an emergency call prior to reporting to work, and in some cases, during work hours. Generally, these laws require the employee to notify the company that he or she has been dispatched to an emergency as soon as possible. The employee may also be required to provide proof that they responded to an emergency call. Some states also permit certain employees to take leave for fire or law enforcement training.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Bereavement Leave:</h2><p class="p">Some states have enacted laws that allow employees to take a leave of absence in order to make funeral arrangements, attend funeral services, or to grieve a family member who has passed away.</p>
