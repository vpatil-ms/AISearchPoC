The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is generally responsible for enforcing these requirements.</p>
<p class="p">These rules include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Executive Order 11246</span>, as amended: Prohibits
               discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender
               identity, or national origin. The Executive Order also requires government
               contractors to take affirmative action to ensure that equal opportunity is provided
               in all aspects of employment (see the next chapter of this guide for more
               information).</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Executive Order 13665:</span> Generally prohibits federal
               contractors and subcontractors from taking adverse employment actions against
               applicants and employees for asking about, discussing, or sharing information about
               their pay or their co-workers' pay.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section
                  503)</span>, as amended: Prohibits federal contractors and subcontractors from
               discriminating in employment against individuals with disabilities, and requires
               these employers to take affirmative action to recruit, hire, promote, and retain
               these individuals.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974
                  (VEVRAA)</span>, as amended: Prohibits federal contractors and subcontractors from
               discriminating in employment against protected veterans, and requires these employers
               to take affirmative action to recruit, hire, promote, and retain these veterans.</span></li>
