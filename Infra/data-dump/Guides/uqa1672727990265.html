The law applies to employers with 20 or more employees. Under the ADEA, it is unlawful to discriminate against a person because of his or her age with respect to any term, condition, or privilege of employment, including hiring, firing, promotion, layoff, compensation, benefits, job assignments, and training. Likewise, a company can not retaliate against an individual for opposing employment practices that discriminate based on age or for filing an age discrimination charge, testifying, or participating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under the ADEA.</p>
<p class="p">ADEA protections include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
         <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Apprenticeship Programs (Including Joint Labor-Management
                  Apprenticeship Programs):</span> Age limitations in apprenticeship programs are
               valid only if they fall within specific exceptions under the ADEA or if the EEOC
               grants a specific exemption.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Job Postings: </span>Job notices or advertisements may
               specify an age limit only in the unusual situations where age is shown to be a <span class="q">“
                  bona fide occupational qualification”</span> reasonably necessary to the normal
               operation of the business.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Screening and Interview Questions:</span> Asking an
               applicant's age or date of birth is acceptable under some circumstances. However,
               since these inquiries may deter older workers from applying for employment or
               otherwise indicate possible intent to discriminate based on age, they will be closely
               scrutinized to make sure they were made for a lawful purpose, rather than for a
               purpose prohibited by the ADEA.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990 ( OWBPA) amended the ADEA to specifically prohibit employers from denying benefits to older employees. Congress recognized that the cost of providing certain benefits to older workers is greater than for younger workers, and that those greater costs would create a disincentive to hire older workers. Therefore, in limited circumstances, an employer may be permitted to reduce benefits based on age, as long as the cost of providing the reduced benefits to older workers is the same that of providing benefits to younger workers.</p>
<p class="p">Businesses may ask an employee to waive his or her rights or claims under the ADEA either in the settlement of an ADEA administrative or court claim or in connection with an exit incentive program or other employment termination program. However, the ADEA, as amended by OWBPA, sets out specific minimum standards that must be met in order for a waiver to be considered knowing and voluntary and, therefore, valid. Among other requirements, a valid ADEA waiver must:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Be in writing and be understandable </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Refer specifically to ADEA rights or claims </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Not waive rights or claims that may arise in the future </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Be in exchange for valuable consideration </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Advise the individual in writing to consult an attorney before signing the waiver </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide the individual at least 21 days to consider the agreement and at least 7 days to revoke the agreement after signing it.</span></li>

         </ul>

The rule clarified that employers may coordinate any retiree health benefits they provided with Medicare without having to ensure that the benefits received by Medicare-eligible retirees were the same as those received by younger retirees.</p>
