      <p class="p">Interviews must be conducted carefully in order to stay within the bounds of federal,
         state, and local laws. You should avoid questions that are expressly prohibited by law and
         those that may directly or indirectly reveal an applicant is a member of a protected group,
         such as inquiries that could involve their race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
         age, disability, genetic information, and military status, among other characteristics.
         Here are several examples of questions to avoid, along with some suggested
         alternatives.</p>

      <section class="section" id="hwp1672727981924__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid #1: Do you smoke? Do you drink alcohol? Are you a medical marijuana user?</h2><p class="p">Several states prohibit discrimination against individuals who use tobacco products or engage in lawful activity while off-duty. Some states also have express employment protections for individuals who use medical marijuana while off-duty. Given these employment protections, it's best to avoid questions about whether an applicant smokes or drinks. These questions may also prompt the candidate to reveal the existence of a disability (see #8 below).</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Alternative:</span> Regardless of the state, employers have
            the right to prohibit the use of, possession of, and impairment by alcohol, marijuana,
            and tobacco in the workplace, during work hours, and on company property. During the
            interview, you may communicate your drug and alcohol policy as long as you do so
            consistently for all similarly situated applicants.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="hwp1672727981924__section_N10050_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid #2: How much did you earn in your previous job?</h2><p class="p">Some states and local jurisdictions have passed laws that restrict or prohibit employers from asking about an applicant's pay history during the hiring process and/or using pay history to make employment decisions (under the premise that pay history may reflect discriminatory pay practices of a previous employer).</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Alternative:</span> These laws generally allow you to
            provide the candidate with the starting salary (or salary range) for the position and
            ask whether it would be acceptable if the candidate were offered the position. In fact,
            certain jurisdictions may require you to provide the salary range of an open position.
            To err on the side of caution, you may also want to tell the candidate not to reveal
            what they earned in their previous job when answering this question.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="hwp1672727981924__section_N1005D_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid #3: Can you provide us with the username and password for your personal social media account so we can take a look?</h2><p class="p">Many states prohibit employers from asking applicants or employees for log-in information for their personal social media and Internet accounts. Check your state law to ensure compliance.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Alternative:</span> None.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="hwp1672727981924__section_N1006A_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid #4: What religion do you practice? Do you have obligations that would prevent you from working Friday evenings, Saturdays, or Sundays? Do you wear that head scarf for religious reasons?</h2><p class="p">Employers are prohibited from discriminating against individuals on the basis of religion. This includes religious beliefs (both traditional as well as non-traditional) and religious practices, such as attending religious services, praying, or wearing religious garb. Generally, you should avoid questions that elicit information about religious beliefs and practices.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Alternative:</span> If you want to confirm an applicant is
            able to work the hours required for the job, state the regular days, hours, or shifts
            for the job and ask whether the candidate can work such a schedule. Keep in mind that
            you may be required to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious beliefs or
            practices, such as allowing an employee to voluntarily swap shifts with a co-worker so
            that they can attend religious services. Interviewers should also be familiar with the
            company's dress code (or any other policy that might call for a religious accommodation)
            and be ready to ask applicants if they can comply, with or without a reasonable
            accommodation. This question can spark a discussion over possible accommodations, if
            applicable. If you do ask this question, be consistent and ask it of all applicants.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="hwp1672727981924__section_N10077_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid #5: How old are you? We went to the same high school…what year did you graduate? Do you plan to retire soon?</h2><p class="p">Under federal law, employers are prohibited from discriminating against applicants and employees who are age 40 and older. Many states also prohibit age discrimination, some protecting even younger workers. The answers to the questions above could be used to estimate the applicant's age.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Alternative:</span> If there are minimum age requirements
            for a job in order to comply with a law or for insurance purposes, you may ask whether
            the applicant meets those requirements.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="hwp1672727981924__section_N10084_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid #6: You have a beautiful name…what is the origin of it? Where is your accent from? Where were you born? Where did you grow up?</h2><p class="p">Federal and many state laws prohibit employers from discriminating against applicants and employees on the basis of national origin (based on where the individual was born or because of their ethnicity or accent). Avoid these questions since they may reveal information about an applicant's national origin.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Alternative:</span> None. However, you are permitted to
            ask if the applicant is authorized to work in the United States, as long as you ask this
            question of all candidates.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="hwp1672727981924__section_N10091_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid #7: Are you pregnant? Do you have or plan to have children? Are you married? Who's responsible for your children's care?</h2><p class="p">Federal law and many state laws prohibit employers from discriminating against individuals because of pregnancy. Some states also expressly prohibit employers from discriminating against applicants because of their marital and/or family status. Avoid interview questions about an applicant's pregnancy, intentions regarding pregnancy, or family and marital status.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Alternative:</span> During the interview, explain
            expectations related to work hours, overtime, and travel and ask the applicant whether
            they can meet those requirements. Be consistent and ask these questions of all
            applicants (not just female applicants).</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="hwp1672727981924__section_N1009E_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid #8: Do you have a disability? How many sick days did you use last year? We ask all candidates this…will you need a reasonable accommodation on the job?</h2><p class="p">The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and similar state laws generally prohibit employers from asking questions during interviews that are likely to reveal the existence of a disability.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Alternative:</span> Under certain circumstances, the ADA
            allows employers to engage in a dialogue regarding whether a qualified candidate would
            need a reasonable accommodation to perform the essential functions of the job. For more
            information, see Question #15 from guidance issued by Equal Employment Opportunity
            Commission (EEOC).</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="hwp1672727981924__section_N100AB_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid #9: Do you have military obligations that would require you to miss work? Do you have military duties on weekends?</h2><p class="p">Under the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Act (USERRA), employers are prohibited from discriminating against applicants and employees due to past, present, or future membership in the uniformed services. Avoid questions about an applicant's military obligations.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Alternative:</span> If applicants voluntarily disclose
            that they served in the military, such as on their resume, you may ask questions
            regarding relevant job-related skills acquired during their service.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="hwp1672727981924__section_N100B8_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid #10: Have you ever been arrested or convicted of a crime?</h2><p class="p">Questions about arrests are generally off limits. Several state and local laws also limit the use of conviction records by prospective employers. For example, some expressly prohibit questions about criminal histories until after the employer makes a conditional job offer. Check applicable laws and consult legal counsel before asking about criminal history.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Alternative:</span> Even where criminal history inquiries
            are permitted, they must be used in a nondiscriminatory way. According to the EEOC,
            employers should evaluate how the specific criminal conduct relates to the duties of a
            particular position. This generally requires an individualized assessment that looks at
            the facts and circumstances surrounding the offense, the number of offenses for which
            the individual was convicted, rehabilitation efforts, and employment or character
            references.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="hwp1672727981924__section_N100C5_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid #11: Have you ever filed a sexual harassment complaint? What about a workers' compensation claim?</h2><p class="p">Under federal and many state laws, employers are prohibited from retaliating against individuals because they opposed unlawful sexual harassment or other forms of discrimination, or participated in a workplace investigation. Many states also prohibit discrimination against individuals because of their workers' compensation history. Questions regarding workers' compensation might also reveal the existence of a disability in violation of the ADA (see #8 above).</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Alternative:</span> None.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="hwp1672727981924__section_N100D2_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Avoid #12: What is your height? What is your weight?</h2><p class="p">A number of state and local jurisdictions specifically prohibit discrimination on the basis of physical appearance, including one's height and weight. Furthermore, the EEOC has taken the position that height and weight requirements tend to disproportionately limit the employment opportunities of certain protected groups, unless certain physical attributes are a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ).</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Alternative:</span> If the job has certain physical
            demands, you may state them and ask whether applicants can meet those requirements. For
            example, <span class="q">“This job requires that the employee regularly move 30
               pounds. Are you able to do so?”</span> If you believe a BFOQ applies (e.g., weight
            requirements for police officers or firefighters), then consult legal counsel before
            asking questions about physical attributes.</p>
