<p class="p">However, if an employer is unable to physically meet with the worker to review Form I-9 documents, federal law allows employers to use an authorized representative to fulfill this function on the employer's behalf. Under this method, the authorized representative will view the documents in the remote employee's presence.</p>
<p class="p">The authorized representative is commonly an attorney or notary public. Under federal rules, an authorized representative can technically be any person the employer designates to complete and sign the I-9 on its behalf.</p>
<p class="p">However, state law may restrict who can complete the I-9 on the employer's behalf. For example, California limits such services to licensed attorneys, individuals authorized under federal law to provide immigration services, and individuals qualified and bonded as an immigration consultant under state law.</p>
<p class="p">Keep in mind that the employer is ultimately responsible for any I-9 violations. Therefore, if you, as the employer, designate a representative, then you should ensure that they have experience in completing the I-9 and you should review the I-9 completed by the designated representative to confirm it is error-free.</p>

      <section class="section" id="eed1706086335339__section_N1005A_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Alternative procedure</h2><p class="p">Beginning August 1, 2023, employers may follow an alternative procedure to the in-person physical document examination method, provided they meet certain requirements. To qualify, employers must be enrolled in E-Verify and be considered in good standing.</p>
<p class="p">The procedure is as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">First, the employee must transmit to the employer a copy of the documents that establish identity and employment eligibility. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Second, the employer must examine the front and back (if the document is two-sided) copy of the identity and employment authorization documentation to ensure that the documentation presented reasonably appears to be genuine. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Third, the employer must conduct a live video interaction with the individual who must present the same documentation to ensure that the documentation reasonably appears to be genuine and related to the individual. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Fourth, the employer must indicate on the new I-9, by completing the corresponding box, that an alternative procedure was used to examine documentation to complete Section 2 or for reverification, as applicable. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Fifth, the employer must retain a clear and legible copy of the documentation (front and back, if the documentation is two-sided), in alignment with applicable recordkeeping regulations. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Sixth and last, the employer is expected to submit an E-Verify case for their new hire following government guidelines. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="eed1706086335339__section_N10082_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><span class="q">“In good standing”</span></h2><p class="p">A participant in good standing in E-Verify is an employer that:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Has enrolled in E-Verify with respect to all hiring sites in the United States that use the alternative procedure; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Is in compliance with all requirements of the E-Verify program, including, but not limited to, verifying the employment eligibility of newly hired employees in the United States; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Continues to be a participant in good standing in E-Verify at any time during which the employer uses the alternative procedure. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">If an employer chooses to offer the alternative procedure to new employees at an E-Verify hiring site, that employer must do so consistently for all employees at that site.</p>
<p class="p">However, an employer may choose to offer the alternative procedure for remote hires only, but continue to apply physical examination procedures to all employees who work onsite or in a hybrid capacity. Employers may do this so long as they do not adopt such a practice for a discriminatory purpose or treat employees differently based on their citizenship, immigration status or national origin.</p>
<p class="p">As mentioned above, employers that use the alternative procedure with an employee must retain a clear and legible copy of all documents presented by the employee seeking to establish identity and employment eligibility for Form I–9.</p>
