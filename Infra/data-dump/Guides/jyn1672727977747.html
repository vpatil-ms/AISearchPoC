In general, the requirement to withhold and pay taxes does not apply to payments made to bona fide independent contractors.</p>
<p class="p">For tax withholding and payment purposes, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses a Common Law test to determine whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee. The test examines factors related to behavioral control, financial control, and the type of relationship between the business and the worker.</p>
<p class="p">All factors must be weighed when determining whether an individual is an employee or independent contractor. There is no set number of factors that must be met, and no one factor stands alone in making this determination.</p>

This factor examines:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Unreimbursed business expenses:</span> As compared with
               employees, independent contractors are more likely to have unreimbursed expenses, or
               fixed ongoing costs that are incurred regardless of whether work is currently being
               performed. Independent contractors are also more likely to realize a profit or incur
               a loss.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Investment in facilities or tools:</span> An independent
               contractor often has a significant investment in the facilities or tools he or she
               uses in performing services for someone else.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Services available to the relevant market:</span> Independent
               contractors often advertise, maintain a visible business location, and are available
               to work for other businesses in the relevant market. Employees, on the other hand,
               generally work for one company at a time.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">How the worker is paid:</span> An employee is generally
               guaranteed a regular rate of pay per hour or pay period. An independent contractor is
               often paid a flat fee or on a time and materials basis.</span></li>

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">There is a written contract describing the relationship the parties intended to create.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The business provides the worker with employee-type benefits, such as health insurance or paid time off.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employer engages a worker with the expectation that the relationship will continue indefinitely, rather than for a specific project or period. This is generally considered evidence of an employer-employee relationship.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The extent to which services performed by the worker are a key aspect of the regular business of the company. If a worker provides services that are a key aspect of the company's regular business, it is more likely that the company will have the right to direct and control his or her activities. For example, if a law firm hires an attorney, it is likely that it will present the attorney's work as its own and would have the right to control or direct that work.</span></li>

The IRS will review the facts and circumstances and officially determine the worker's status. Ordinarily, this process takes at least six months. If you are unsure whether a worker qualifies as an independent contractor, err on the side of caution and classify the individual as an employee.</p>
