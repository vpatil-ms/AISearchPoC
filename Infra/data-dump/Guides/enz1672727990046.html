      <p class="p">At-will employment generally means that, absent certain exceptions such as an expressed or
         implied contract or public policy, either you or the employee can terminate the employment
         relationship at any time and for any reason, as long as the reason is a lawful one. At-will
         employment is recognized in every state but Montana.</p>

      <section class="section" id="enz1672727990046__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Implied Contracts</h2><p class="p">You can jeopardize an employee's at-will status with implied contracts, such as those created via oral or written statements. For instance, <span class="q">“don't worry—you will always have a job with us”</span> could be interpreted as a promise of permanent employment. Certain policies and practices can also create an implied contract. For example, if drafted incorrectly, discipline policies may lock you into taking one course of action, such as policies that indicate a verbal warning will be given for all first offenses, a written warning for all second offenses, and so on (commonly known as progressive discipline), when the situation may call for a more severe course of action, such as termination.</p>

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Prominently display an at-will employment statement in the beginning of your employee handbook (except in Montana, where at-will employment isn't recognized). Reinforce at-will status in your handbook acknowledgment form as well. Here's an example of an at-will statement:</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph em">Employment with [Company Name] is <span class="q">“at-will.”</span> This means employees are free to resign at any
                  time, with or without cause, and [Company Name] may terminate the employment
                  relationship at any time, for any lawful reason, with or without cause or advance
                  notice. As an at-will employee, you are not guaranteed employment with [Company
                  Name] for any set period of time.</span></span></li>

            <li><span class="li"> The policies set forth in this employee handbook are the policies that are in effect at the time of publication. They may be amended, modified, or terminated at any time by [Company Name], except for the policy on at-will employment, which may be modified only by a signed, written agreement between the President and the employee at issue. Nothing in this handbook may be construed as creating a promise of future benefits or a binding contract between [Company Name] and any of its employees.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Avoid policies that restrict your ability to decide what type of discipline is appropriate given the severity of the offense and the employee's history of misconduct. State that violations may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and that the company reserves the right to decide what disciplinary action to take in any given situation. Keep in mind, however, that treating employees fairly is key and similar situations and past practices should guide and impact the disciplinary action that you take.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Train all supervisors to avoid using language or making statements that may be construed as an offer or promise of future employment. </span></li>
