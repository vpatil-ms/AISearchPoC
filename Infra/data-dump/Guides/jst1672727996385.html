      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reference Checks</h2><p class="p">To help make informed hiring decisions, employers often ask for references from prospective employees. It is generally considered a best practice to wait until you have extended a conditional offer of employment before conducting reference checks. If your company performs reference checks earlier in the hiring process, make sure you are consistent about the timing and confirm that you can lawfully obtain the information you are requesting before extending an offer. Here are some more best practices:</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Obtain authorization.</h2><p class="p">Prior to checking a potential employee's reference, obtain and retain written authorization from the individual. Ask applicants to sign a form authorizing their former employer to disclose job-related information to your company.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Decide what information to request.</h2><p class="p">During the hiring process, many employers use reference checks to verify information provided in employment applications, resumes, and interviews. For instance, they may use the reference check to confirm dates of employment, positions held, reasons for leaving, and eligibility for rehire. Most employers are willing to disclose this type of information but may be less inclined to provide information on performance- or conduct-related issues.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Request and use only job-related information.</h2><p class="p">Reference checks for all similarly situated candidates must be subject to the same set of questions and should only seek job-related information. Never ask for or use information that is protected by federal, state, or local law. Even if you ask for strictly job-related information, it is possible a former employer may inadvertently disclose protected information (e.g., the individual's age, national origin, family status, etc.). In these cases, disregard such information when making a hiring decision.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Talk to references directly.</h2><p class="p">It is a best practice to contact a reference directly via phone, even if a job candidate provides a letter from the reference. Most employers check at least three references. These should generally be professional references from previous employers. Ideally, the reference should be someone who has directly supervised the employee. On the phone, be sure to verify the reference's role in relation to the applicant.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Comply with FCRA if using a third party.</h2><p class="p">If you hire another company to perform certain background or reference checks, you must make sure you comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Among other things, the FCRA requires that employers provide written notification to, and obtain authorization from, any individual subject to a background investigation. The FCRA also has very specific guidelines employers must follow when taking adverse action against an individual (e.g., failing to hire) based on the results of the investigation. Several states have their own laws similar to the FCRA so it is important to review applicable state laws to ensure compliance.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Document.</h2><p class="p">Retain records supporting your hiring decision, including reference check information. Document when reference checks were conducted, who was contacted, and the job-related information gathered and used to make the hiring decision.</p>
