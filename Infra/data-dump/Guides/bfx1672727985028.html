            Contractors:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">While all federal contractors must take affirmative action, Executive
            Order 11246 requires that service and supply contractors with 50 or more employees and
            government contracts of $50,000 or more to develop and implement a written affirmative
            action program (AAP) for each establishment. The regulations define an AAP as a set of
            specific and result-oriented procedures to which a contractor commits to applying every
            good faith effort. The AAP must be reviewed and updated at least annually and include
            the following elements:</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Organizational Profile</span></p>

         <p class="p">Provides an overview of the workforce at the establishment and may assist
            in identifying organizational units where women or minorities are underrepresented or
            concentrated. The contractor must use either the organizational display or the workforce
            analysis (see below) as its organizational profile.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Display</span></p>

         <p class="p">A detailed graphical or tabular chart, text, spreadsheet or similar
            presentation of the contractor's organizational structure. The organizational display
            must identify each organizational unit in the establishment, and show the relationship
            of each organizational unit to the other organizational units in the establishment.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Workforce Analysis</span></p>

         <p class="p">A listing of each job title as it appears in applicable collective
            bargaining agreements or payroll records ranked from the lowest paid to the highest paid
            within each department or other similar organizational unit including departmental or
            unit supervision.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Job Group Analysis</span></p>

         <p class="p">A method of combining job titles within the contractor's establishment.
            This is the first step in the contractor's comparison of the representation of
            minorities and women in its workforce with the estimated availability of minorities and
            women qualified to be employed.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Placement of Incumbents in Job Groups</span></p>

         <p class="p">A statement of the percentage of minorities and the percentage of women
            employed in each job group established in the job group analysis.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Determining Availability</span></p>

         <p class="p">An estimate of the number of qualified minorities or women available for
            employment in a given job group, expressed as a percentage of all qualified persons
            available for employment in the job group.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Comparing Availability to Incumbency</span></p>

         <p class="p">A comparison of the percentage of minorities and women in each job group
            determined with the availability for those job groups.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Placement Goals</span></p>

         <p class="p">Objectives or targets reasonably attainable by means of applying every
            good faith effort to make all aspects of the entire affirmative action program work.
            Placement goals also are used to measure progress toward achieving equal employment
            opportunity.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Designation of Responsibility</span></p>

         <p class="p">The assignment of responsibility and accountability for EEO and
            affirmative action to an official of the organization. He or she must have the
            authority, resources, support of and access to top management to ensure the effective
            implementation of the affirmative action program.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Identification of Problem Areasdentification of
               Problem Areas</span></p>

         <p class="p">An in-depth analysis of its total employment process to determine
            whether and where impediments to equal employment opportunity exist.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Action-Oriented Programs</span></p>

         <p class="p">Actions designed to correct any problem areas identified and to attain
            established goals and objectives. Contractors must demonstrate that they have made good
            faith efforts to remove identified barriers, expand employment opportunities, and
            produce measurable results.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Internal Audit and Reporting System</span></p>

         <p class="p">A system that measures and monitors the effectiveness of the entire
            affirmative action program.</p>

For example, the OFCCP, rather than the contractor, establishes goals and specifies affirmative action that must be undertaken by federal and federally assisted construction contractors. The regulations list the good faith steps construction contractors must take in order to increase the utilization of minorities and women in the skilled trades.
