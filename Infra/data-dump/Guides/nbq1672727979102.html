      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Glossary of Terms</h2><p class="p">ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA): Expanded the definition of <span class="q">“disability”</span> under the ADA, making it easier for individuals seeking protection under the ADA to establish that they have a disability.</p>
<p class="p">Disability: (1) A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; or (2) A record of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited a major life activity; or (3) When a covered entity takes an action prohibited by the ADA because of an actual or perceived impairment that is not both transitory and minor.</p>
<p class="p">Physical or mental impairment: Any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more body systems, such as neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, immune, circulatory, hemic, lymphatic, skin and endocrine. Any mental or psychological disorder, such as intellectual disability, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities.</p>
<p class="p">Substantially limits: An impairment is a disability under the ADA if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population. An impairment need not prevent, or significantly restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting.</p>
<p class="p">Major life activities: Include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others, and working. Major life activities also include the operation of major bodily functions, including functions of the immune system, special sense organs and skin, normal cell growth, digestive, genitourinary, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, cardiovascular, endocrine, hemic, lymphatic, musculoskeletal, and reproductive functions. Major bodily functions also include the operation of an individual organ within a body system (e.g., the operation of the kidney, liver, or pancreas).</p>
<p class="p">Mitigating measures: Measures that eliminate or reduce the symptoms or impact of an impairment. The positive effects from an individual's use of mitigating measures, other than ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses, must be ignored in determining if an impairment substantially limits a major life activity.</p>
<p class="p">Regarded as: When an individual is subjected to an action prohibited by the ADA (e.g., failure to hire, termination, or demotion) because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment, whether or not that impairment substantially limits, or is perceived to substantially limit, a major life activity.</p>
<p class="p">Essential functions: The fundamental job duties of the position. The term <span class="q">“essential functions”</span> does not include marginal or incidental functions.</p>
<p class="p">Qualified individual: An individual who can perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation. A person who meets the skill, experience, education, or other requirements of a position.</p>
<p class="p">Reasonable accommodation: Any modification or adjustment to a job or the work environment that will enable a qualified applicant or employee with a disability to participate in the application process or to perform the essential functions of the job. Reasonable accommodation also includes adjustments to assure that a qualified individual with a disability has rights and privileges in employment equal to those of employees without disabilities.</p>
<p class="p">Undue hardship: An action requiring significant difficulty or expense. Employers are not required to provide accommodations that will cause undue hardship.</p>
<p class="p">Interactive Process: A discussion between an employer and employee aimed at identifying what, if any, reasonable accommodation can be provided.</p>
