When a former employee has filed a claim for unemployment benefits, you will receive written notice from the state unemployment agency. In general, you may acknowledge the claim as valid or dispute it.</p>
<p class="p">Because your unemployment compensation tax is closely tied to your company's claims history, you should immediately challenge any claim that you believe is not justified. Not all claims are worth contesting, of course, only those for which you have a strong, well-documented case.</p>
<p class="p">In many states, it is assumed that a claim is valid if no information to the contrary is supplied by the employer within a certain deadline, typically 7 to 14 days following receipt of the claim notice. Once the response deadline passes, it is usually too late to object to the worker's collection of benefits. For this reason, you may wish to consider sending your objection to the agency by certified mail.</p>
<p class="p">Good recordkeeping is essential in successfully contesting any claim. Employers should keep track of the facts surrounding each separation and know their state unemployment laws. Documentation of disciplinary notices, resignation letters, and other related evidence demonstrating the reason for termination will be vital in supporting your case.</p>
<p class="p">Once a claim is contested, in-person hearings are often scheduled shortly thereafter. Employers will then receive notice of the date, time, and place to report and should always come prepared with as much information as possible. Additionally, it's important to have a solid grasp on the laws that apply to your case. The law should support your view that the worker was separated under disqualifying conditions, such as misconduct or voluntary resignation with good cause. Legal representation at the hearing may be appropriate-particularly in contentious situations where other employment-related litigation may be anticipated. The hearing officer will issue a written decision shortly after the hearing. Although not particularly cost-effective, employers that are dissatisfied with the outcome of the hearing can generally protest the hearing officer's decision to one or more appeals within the state unemployment agency itself and then through the state court system.</p>
<p class="p">In general, the grounds for disqualification are narrow and are interpreted in a way favorable to the separated employee whenever possible. However, workers can be legitimately denied benefits for a number of reasons, such as simply not earning enough in wages to qualify, being discharged for misconduct, or for voluntarily resigning <span class="q">“without good cause”</span>.</p>
