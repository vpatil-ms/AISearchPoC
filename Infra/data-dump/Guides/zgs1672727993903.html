      <p class="p">OSHA has encouraged employees and employers alike to make occupational health and safety
         initiatives paramount. To this end, OSHA has created the following programs: the Voluntary
         Protection Program, the Strategic Partnership Program, and the Alliance Program.</p>

      <section class="section" id="zgs1672727993903__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Voluntary Protection Program:</h2><p class="p">OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) provides an opportunity for labor, management, and government to work together cooperatively to further the goal of providing effective safety and health protection in the workplace. The VPP grants recognition to worksites that provide, or are committed to providing, effective protection for their employees through implementation of systematically managed safety and health programs.</p>
<p class="p">All groups covered by OSHA are eligible to join the VPP. Each worksite that applies must show a commitment to effective safe and health management systems and work to be an industry leader in occupational safety and health.</p>
<p class="p">There are three levels of recognition; each is designed with different criteria to allow the opportunity for a wide range of safety and health programs to be recognized.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Star Program. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Merit Program. </span></li>

The OSPP is designed to enable groups of employers, employees, and employee representatives to partner with OSHA and enter into an extended, voluntary, and cooperative relationship in order to encourage, assist, and recognize efforts to eliminate serious hazards and achieve a high level of worker safety and health.</p>
