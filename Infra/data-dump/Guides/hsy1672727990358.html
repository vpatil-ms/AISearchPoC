Most importantly, your policy should state your position on harassment and intent to take appropriate dis­ciplinary action against violators. It should be included in your employee handbook and posted on all bulletin boards. Include the following points:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Coverage:</span> Specify the groups that are protected from
               harassment by state and federal law, but also indi­cate that harassment of any
               individual will not be permitted. Note that temporary employees and contractors are
               also protected. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Definition:</span> Specify what types of acts constitute
               harassment; point out that employees must treat others respectfully. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Complaint Procedures: </span>Your policy should indicate the
               individual to whom employees should report alleged harassment. This is usually the
               supervisor, or the human resources department. If employees are to complain to a
               supervisor, indicate the person to whom employees should complain if the alleged
               harassment has been committed by a supervisor. Be certain that employees on all
               shifts and in all locations have a complaint system. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Supervisors' Responsibilities:</span> Inform supervisors to
               whom they should report complaints and what actions they should take upon receiving a
               complaint. Protocol for handling general harassment may be part of sexual harassment
               training. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong"/> Indicate who will conduct the investigation of the
               alleged harassment. Ideally, two people, including one member of one of
               tInvestigation:he protected groups, should be present during investigation
               interviews. Your policy should provide that instances of harassment will be
               investigated even if no formal complaint is filed. State that all employees are
               expected to cooperate with an investigation and that giving false information in the
               course of an investigation is grounds for discipline. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Disciplinary Action:</span> List the types of action that may
               be taken in response to policy violations, depending on the severity of the
               harassment and other factors. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Privacy:</span> Disclosure of information about complaints
               should be limited to those with a legitimate involvement. Your policy should state
               that information about complaints will be held in confidence to the extent possible
               but do not guarantee absolute confidentiality. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Prevention:</span> Explain management's responsibility to
               notify workers of the harassment policy and its enforcement. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong"/>Retaliation: Employees should know that they are protected
               from retaliation if they file a complaint or participate in an investigation. </span></li>
