      <p class="p">Prior to starting the recruiting process, develop a well-crafted job description for your
         open position. Job descriptions identify the essential functions and qualifications needed
         for the role. These are key elements for a job advertisement and for assessing whether
         applicants meet the minimum requirements for the job. Job ads generally include certain
         elements of the job description, such as the essential functions and qualifications, as
         well as additional information to attract qualified candidates.</p>

      <p class="p">Here are six common elements of a job description:</p>

      <section class="section" id="ypl1672727980965__section_N10047_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Job Details</h2><p class="p">Generally, this section is at the top of the job description and includes:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Job title:</span> Accurately reflect the job
               and its status within the organization (e.g., senior project manager).</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Reporting structure:</span> Provide the title
               of the reporting supervisor, rather than their name.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Exempt vs. non-exempt status:</span> Any
               position may be classified as non-exempt from overtime. However, certain federal and
               state tests must be satisfied to be considered exempt. Before designating a position
               as exempt, be sure to carefully apply the appropriate tests.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Job summary:</span> A brief (one or two
               sentences) synopsis of the job that includes the most important functions of the
               role.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Dates and approvals:</span> Include the date
               the job description was created or last revised as well as who created and approved
               it. </span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="ypl1672727980965__section_N10068_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Essential Functions</h2><p class="p">Each job description should have a list of essential functions. Essential functions are the job duties that an employee must be able to perform with or without a reasonable accommodation. Consider:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Whether the job was created to perform that function; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">How often and for how much time the employee is expected to perform the function; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The number of other employees available to perform the function; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The degree of expertise or skill required. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Use brief sentences in the present tense, beginning with an action verb. For example, an essential function for a maintenance technician might read: <span class="q">“Diagnose mechanical problems and determine how to correct them.”</span></p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="ypl1672727980965__section_N1008B_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Non-Essential Functions</h2><p class="p">If there are additional tasks or responsibilities the employee may be required to perform during the course of their job, but are not essential to the job, include them here. It's a best practice to list these responsibilities separately from the essential functions.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="ypl1672727980965__section_N10095_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Qualifications and Skills</h2><p class="p">In each job description, include the training, education, certification(s), and years of experience needed to perform the job. In some cases, education may be a substitute for the requisite experience and/or vice versa. If so, indicate that in the job description. Additionally, provide a list of basic, technical, or other skills, knowledge, or abilities, needed for the role.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="ypl1672727980965__section_N1009F_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Physical Demands and Work Environment</h2><p class="p">If the physical demands and/or work environment are essential to the job, include them in your job description. If you include physical demands, focus on the task that needs to be done, rather than how it should be done. For example, say that the position requires <span class="q">“moving”</span> 50 pounds, instead of <span class="q">“lifting”</span> 50 pounds, or say "traversing" the length of the warehouse instead of "walking" the length of the warehouse. Employees with disabilities may be able to perform the essential functions of the job with an accommodation, such as using a cart, dolly, or mobility aid. If the job involves work in hazardous or adverse conditions, or a particular work environment (outdoors, extreme heat or cold), include that information in your job description as well.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="ypl1672727980965__section_N100B1_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Scope and Changes</h2><p class="p">Include a statement indicating that the:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Job description is not intended to cover every single requirement of the job. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The company reserves the right to change job duties at any time. </span></li>
