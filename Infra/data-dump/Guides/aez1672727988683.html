<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Not clearly publicizing an employment-at-will disclaimer. Employers should have a separate employment-at-will policy that informs employees that the handbook is not intended as a contract of employment. This should be the first policy and should stand out with large or boldface font.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Failing to consider state and local laws. State and local laws often provide for greater protections than what is afforded to employees under federal law. Make sure that you take into consideration state and local laws when drafting and revising your employee handbook.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Being overly vague. Avoid being too general or allowing too much room for interpretation. More than likely your policies will be interpreted differently if they are not clearly worded.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Being overly specific. You cannot be expected to think of all circumstances and contingencies. Therefore, avoid exhaustive lists and provide a few examples instead.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Failing to allow for management discretion. Certain circumstances may require employers to use their discretion when applying policies. Because you cannot be expected to think of all circumstances and mitigating factors, include statements that management reserves the right to use its discretion when implementing or enforcing workplace policies.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Failing to consider NLRB guidance. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) enforces the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Among other things, the NLRA grants employees the right to act together to improve wages and working conditions. Make sure your policies do not restrict employees' rights to discuss wages, benefits, and working conditions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Failing to include acknowledgment pages. The employee handbook should include an acknowledgment page, to be signed by the employee, that states the employee has received, read and understands the handbook. This page should also contain language that employment is at-will and that the employer retains the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, alter or amend the handbook at any time (see Handbook Acknowledgments for more information). </span></li>
