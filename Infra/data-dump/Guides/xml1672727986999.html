      <p class="p"> The purpose of OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (HCS), commonly known as worker
            <span class="q">“Right to Know”</span> is to ensure that the hazards of all chemicals produced or imported
         are evaluated and that information is transmitted to employers and employees.</p>

      <p class="p">The HCS requires chemical manufacturers and importers to evaluate the hazards of the
         chemicals they produce or import and prepare labels and safety data sheets (formerly known
         as material safety data sheets or MSDS) to convey hazard information to their downstream
         customers (e.g. employers). Employers with hazardous chemicals must have a written hazard
         communication plan, appropriate chemical labels and safety data sheets (SDS), and training
         for their exposed workers.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xml1672727986999__section_N1004B_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">HCS Final Rule:</h2><p class="p">In March 2012, OSHA published a final rule revising the HCS. The rule changes how chemical hazards must be communicated in labels and SDS and requires employers to train their employees on the new labels and SDS.</p>
<p class="p">The final rule makes changes to the HCS to align it with the United Nations' global chemical labeling system (GHS). The GHS is an international approach to hazard communication, providing agreed criteria for classification of chemical hazards, and a standardized approach to label elements and safety data sheets.</p>
<p class="p">The changes that result from the final rule include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Revised criteria for classification of chemical hazards;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Revised labeling provisions that include requirements for the use of standardized signal words, pictograms, hazard statements, and precautionary statements;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Changes in terminology;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A specified 16-section format for SDS; and</span></li>

      <section class="section" id="xml1672727986999__section_N100CC_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Chemical Labels:</h2><p class="p">All hazardous chemical containers must be labeled. This labeling must be easily readable and prominently displayed on the container. The purpose of such labeling is to provide employees with an immediate warning of hazardous chemicals and remind them that more detailed information is available.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Effective June 1, 2015</span>, all hazardous chemical
            labels will be required to have pictograms, a signal word, hazard and precautionary
            statements, the product identifier, and supplier identification. These requirements are
            detailed below:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Pictogram:</span> A symbol plus other graphic
               elements, such as a border, background pattern, or color that is intended to convey
               specific information about the hazards of a chemical. Each pictogram consists of a
               different symbol on a white background within a red square frame set on a point (i.e.
               a red diamond). There are eight pictograms required under the HCS.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Signal words:</span> A single word used to
               indicate the relative level of severity of hazard and alert the reader to a potential
               hazard on the label. The signal words used are <span class="q">“danger”</span> and <span class="q">“warning.”</span> "Danger" is used for the more severe hazards, while
               "warning" is used for less severe hazards.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Hazard statement:</span> A statement assigned
               to a hazard class and category that describes the nature of the hazard(s) of a
               chemical, including, where appropriate, the degree of hazard.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Precautionary statement: </span>A phrase that
               describes recommended measures to be taken to minimize or prevent adverse effects
               resulting from exposure to a hazardous chemical, or improper storage or handling of a
               hazardous chemical.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Employers have the option to label workplace containers either with the same label that would be on shipped containers for the chemical or with label alternatives (such as the National Fire Protection Association 704 Hazard Rating and the Hazardous Material Information System) as long as the labels meet the requirements of, and the information is consistent with, the revised HCS (e.g., no conflicting hazard warnings or pictograms).</p>

      <section class="section" id="xml1672727986999__section_N100F7_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employee Training:</h2><p class="p">Employers must provide employees with effective training on hazardous chemicals in their work area at the time of their initial assignment and whenever a new chemical hazard is introduced into their work area. Training must include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Methods and observations that may be used to detect the presence or release of a hazardous chemical in the work area (such as monitoring conducted by the employer, continuous monitoring devices, visual appearance or odor of hazardous chemicals when being released, etc.);</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The physical and health hazards of the chemicals in the work area;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The measures employees can take to protect themselves from these
               hazards, including specific procedures the employer has implemented to protect
               employees from exposure to hazardous chemicals, such as appropriate work practices,
               emergency procedures, and personal protective equipment to be used; <span class="ph strong">and</span></span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The details of the hazard communication program developed by the employer, including an explanation of the labeling system and the SDS, and how employees can obtain and use the appropriate hazard information.</span></li>

OSHA representatives must be given immediate access to exposure records. Employers are required to retain records of exposure for thirty (30) years.</p>
