      <p class="p">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employers with 15 or more employees from
         discriminating against employees or applicants based on their race or color. Furthermore,
         employment decisions cannot be based on stereotypes or assumptions about abilities, traits,
         or the performance of individuals of certain racial groups. Both intentional discrimination
         and neutral job policies that disproportionately exclude individuals based on race and are
         not job-related and not consistent with business necessity are unlawful. EEO cannot be
         denied because of marriage to, or association with, an individual of a different race;
         membership in or association with ethnic based organizations or groups; or
         attendance/participation in schools or places of worship generally associated with certain
         minority groups. In addition, it is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's
         race or color.</p>

      <section class="section" id="swp1672727977575__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Race and Color Specifics</h2><p class="p">It is a violation of Title VII to discriminate on the basis of a characteristic associated with race, such as skin color, hair texture, or certain facial features, even though this trait may not be shared by all members of the race. It is also unlawful to discriminate on the basis of a condition that mostly affects one race, such as sickle cell anemia in African Americans, unless job-related and consistent with business necessity. Harassment on the basis of race and/or color, such as ethnic slurs, racial <span class="q">“jokes,”</span> offensive or derogatory comments, or other verbal or physical conduct is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="p">Title VII is violated when employees of a certain group are physically isolated from other employees or customers. Likewise, employers may not assign employees according to race or color, such as primarily placing Asian Americans in a certain location or geographic area. It is also illegal to exclude members of one group from particular positions or to categorize employees or jobs so that some jobs are generally held by members of a certain protected group.</p>
<p class="p">Color discrimination occurs when a person is discriminated against based on skin pigmentation (lightness or darkness of the skin), complexion, shade, or tone. Color discrimination can occur between persons of different races or ethnicities, or even between persons of the same race or ethnicity. For example, an African American employer violates Title VII if he refuses to hire other African Americans whose skin is either darker or lighter than his own.</p>
<p class="p">The protections against race and color discrimination apply to all individuals, not just those of a minority group.</p>

            discloses or tends to disclose an applicant's race. The EEOC's position is that
            solicitation of such information suggests that it will be used as a basis for making
            selection decisions. However, if an employer legitimately needs information about its
            employees' or applicants' race for affirmative action purposes and/or to track applicant
            flow, they may obtain racial information <span class="ph em">if</span> they
            simultaneously guard against discriminatory selection by using <span class="q">“tear-off sheets”</span> for the identification of an applicant's race. After the
            candidate completes the application and the tear-off portion, the employer separates the
            sheet from the application and does not use it in the selection process.</p>

It includes not only racial animosity, but also conscious or unconscious stereotypes about the abilities, traits, or performance of individuals of certain racial groups.</p>
<p class="p">Disparate impact discrimination occurs when a neutral employment policy or practice disproportionately affects certain races.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Example:</span> An employer has a <span class="q">“no-beard”</span> rule, which disproportionately excludes African American men because
            they have a higher incidence of pseudofolliculitis barbae, an inflammatory skin
            condition caused by shaving. The employer must be able to demonstrate that beards affect
            job performance or safety. Also, there must be no alternatives to a strict <span class="q">“no-beard”</span> rule that would meet the employer's business or safety
            needs.</p>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Job advertisements:</span> Employers should
               avoid expressing a racial preference in job advertisements. Employers can indicate
               that they are <span class="q">“equal opportunity employers.”</span></span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Employee referrals:</span> Employee referrals
               involve employees spreading information concerning job vacancies to their family,
               friends, and acquaintances. Unless the workforce is racially and ethnically diverse,
               exclusive reliance on employee referrals should be avoided because it may create a
               barrier to equal employment opportunity for groups that are not already represented
               in the employer's workforce. Employee referrals should be just one part of a
               diversified recruiting effort.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Recruitment sources:</span> Employers should
               attempt to recruit from racially diverse sources in order to obtain a racially
               diverse applicant pool. For example, if the employer's primary recruitment source is
               a college that has few African American students, the employer should adopt other
               recruitment strategies, such as also recruiting at predominantly African American
               colleges, to ensure that its applicant pool reflects the diversity of the qualified
               labor force. </span></li>
