      <p class="p">The performance review should be an interactive discussion between you and the employee. To put the employee at ease, start the meeting off by explaining that the purpose of the review is to improve performance and foster professional growth. Focus on the exchange of feedback and collaborate on action plans for the future. Explain what procedure or format you'd like to follow for the discussion.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Deliver Ratings:</h2><p class="p">When delivering performance ratings, supervisors should:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Discuss each goal or objective established for the employee </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Review all ratings with the employee and provide examples of specific performance </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Give the employee an opportunity to comment </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Recognize all positive skills, traits, accomplishments </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Identify all areas where improvement is required </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">To help keep the employee engaged, start the conversation with positive feedback before delving into areas where the employee needs to improve. While you should acknowledge the positive aspects of every employee's performance, don't avoid or dance around negative feedback—be clear and straight forward and provide examples of performance issues. If you have communicated performance concerns in the past, such as in a written or verbal warning, remind the employee of past discussions and provide documentation if applicable. Additionally, provide strategies and suggestions for ways to improve performance.</p>
<p class="p">The performance review should be a constructive conversation, not a debate. If the employee presents new information that is relevant to the performance review (such as claims to have made more sales than indicated in the review), let the employee know that you will look into the new information following the meeting. Avoid making any promises that you will change the performance rating and schedule a follow-up meeting if necessary.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Develop an Action Plan:</h2><p class="p">If an employee was unable to meet their goals, discuss the specific reasons why. Outline and agree to an action plan for the next review period to clarify mutual expectations for the future. Discuss future targets as well as strategies that can help the employee to meet those goals. Be flexible and adjust goals impacted by resource constraints or other circumstances beyond the employee's control.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Close:</h2><p class="p">Performance meetings should end with clear expectations for the future. Ask the employee if they have any questions or issues they would like to discuss. Summarize your ratings and confirm performance goals for the next review period. Ask the employee to sign the written review. If the employee refuses to sign, explain that the purpose of the signature is to confirm that the employee received the information, not that they necessarily agree with it. If the employee disagrees with the performance review, give the employee an opportunity to provide a written statement explaining why they disagree with the review. If the employee still refuses to sign, note that on the performance record and then date it. Set a date for follow-up and thank the employee for their contributions.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">After the Meeting:</h2><p class="p">Following the meeting, review and finalize the performance appraisal form. Any loose notes taken should be attached, along with the employee's written statement, if provided. The acknowledged form should be retained in the employee's personnel file.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Follow Up:</h2><p class="p">The supervisor should have regular meetings with the employee to discuss progress. Action plans should be reviewed and updated if necessary. These meetings should be documented and can be used to support future performance discussions.</p>
