      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Breaks for Nursing Mothers</h2><p class="p">The FLSA was amended to require breaks for nursing mothers.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Time, Frequency and Location:</h2><p class="p">Employers are required to provide a reasonable amount of break time for a nursing mother to express milk as frequently as needed for up to one year after the child's birth.</p>
<p class="p">Employers must provide a place, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the public. If the space is not dedicated to the nursing mother's use, it must be available when needed.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Covered Employees:</h2><p class="p">Both exempt and non-exempt employees are entitled to breaks to express milk.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Pay:</h2><p class="p">The break time may be unpaid unless otherwise required to be paid by federal, state or municipal law, provided the employee is completely relieved from duty during the entirety of the break.</p>
<div class="note note"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>With limited exceptions, federal law requires employers to pay exempt employees their full salary in any workweek in which they perform any work, regardless of the quantity or quality of the work. As such, deductions from any exempt employees' salary for such breaks are prohibited.</p>
</div>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Undue Hardship Exception:</h2><p class="p">There is an exception to the break requirement for employers with less than 50 employees if providing such breaks would impose an undue hardship on the business.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"> State Law Impact:</h2><p class="p">This FLSA requirement does not preempt state laws that provide greater protections to em­ployees (e.g., paid break time or breaks for nursing mothers beyond one year after the child's birth).</p>
