It represents the <span class="q">“fixed”</span> portion of a salary an employee receives for consistently and effectively performing his or her job. In general, base pay is derived from employees' knowledge, skills, and abilities, pay history, internal equity, and external equity. Base pay is typically adjusted annually through performance reviews and corresponding wage increases.</p>
<p class="p">In an effort to better use compensation programs to motivate employees, a growing number of employers have implemented performance-based pay. Performance-based pay--also known as variable pay or incentive pay--is compensation that is tied to meeting specific goals. The incentives can be tied to individual or group performance. Performance-based pay is attractive to some employers because it recognizes exceptional performance without raising fixed costs.</p>
<p class="p"> One key consideration for employers is determining the mix between base pay and performance-based pay. That is, how much of an employee's compensation is guaranteed and how much is at risk each year the employee is employed. The exact mix will differ from one organization to another and among different jobs. </p>
