      <p class="p"> Some employers use drug testing as part of their hiring process. Most states permit
         pre-employment drug testing, but some states have conditions employers must meet before
         conducting a drug test. For example, some states require notice, and have specific rules on
         administering a drug testing program. Some have restrictions on when in the hiring process
         employers can conduct a drug test, such as after a conditional offer of employment. Some
         states also require employers to have a written policy outlining specific elements of
         pre-employment drug testing. Both federal and state laws have drug testing requirements for
         safety-sensitive positions so review your applicable law before implementing a drug testing
         program.</p>

         <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>If a CRA obtains the drug test, it may be considered a consumer report and subject to
            FCRA requirements.</p>

      <section class="section" id="icc1672727990624__section_N1004D_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Marijuana</h2><p class="p">Drug testing has become increasingly complicated because of changing state and local marijuana laws. Most states permit medical marijuana, and around 20 states also permit recreational marijuana use. While none of these laws require employers to allow employees to use, possess, or be impaired by marijuana during work hours or in the workplace, several states have employment protections for employees who use marijuana outside of work.</p>
<p class="p">Some states prohibit employers from making employment decisions based solely on a person's status as a medical marijuana user or cardholder. Additionally, a few states prohibit discrimination against individuals because they test positive for medical marijuana, unless the individual used, possessed, or was impaired by marijuana in the workplace or during work hours. Some jurisdictions go even further. For instance, Nevada generally prohibits employers from refusing to hire a prospective employee because their test results indicate the presence of marijuana (not just medical marijuana). New York City prohibits employers from conducting pre-employment testing for marijuana. In addition, courts in some states have ruled that under certain circumstances employers may be required to allow off-duty medical marijuana use as a reasonable accommodation for a disability under state law.</p>
<p class="p">Keep in mind there may be situations in which the employer is required to take action against an applicant who uses marijuana. For example, the Department of Transportation (DOT) does not permit any employee in a safety-sensitive position (and subject to DOT drug testing regulations) to use marijuana.</p>
<p class="p">Before testing for marijuana and/or making any employment decisions resulting from an individual's use of marijuana, check applicable federal, state, and local laws and work closely with legal counsel to determine your rights and responsibilities.</p>
