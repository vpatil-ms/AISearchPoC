These employers may be eligible for grants if they did not have a wellness program in place on March 23, 2010.</p>

      <section class="section" id="skb1672727997527__section_N1004D_N10040_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Categories of Wellness Programs:</h2><p class="p">Employment-based wellness programs can be divided into two broad categories: participatory wellness programs and health-contingent wellness programs.</p>
<p class="p">Participatory Wellness Programs:</p>
<p class="p">Participatory wellness programs do not require an employee to meet a specific health-related standard to obtain a reward offered by the employer. Some examples of these types of programs include reimbursement for the cost of a fitness center membership or reimbursement for a smoking cessation program. As long as these types of programs are uniformly applied to all similarly situated employees, they comply with the nondiscrimination requirements without having to satisfy additional criteria.</p>
<p class="p">Health-contingent Wellness Programs:</p>
<p class="p">Health-contingent wellness programs require an employee to meet a certain health-related standard or outcome in order to obtain a reward. Examples of these types of programs include achieving specific results due to exercise and diet programs or achieving a specified cholesterol level. These programs must follow certain nondiscrimination rules.</p>

      <section class="section" id="skb1672727997527__section_N10063_N10040_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reasonable Design:</h2><p class="p">Wellness programs must be reasonably designed. Generally, a wellness program is reasonably designed if it has a reasonable chance of improving the health or preventing disease in participating employees. The program should also be designed so that it is not overly burdensome to the employee, is not a deception for discrimination based on a health factor, and is not highly suspicious in the method chosen to promote health.</p>

      <section class="section" id="skb1672727997527__section_N1006D_N10040_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Required Components:</h2><p class="p">To be eligible for the grant, the wellness program must contain the following elements:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Health awareness initiatives, including health education, preventive screenings, and health risk assessments;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Efforts to maximize employee engagement, including mechanisms to encourage employee participation;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Initiatives to change unhealthy behaviors and lifestyle choices, including
               counseling, seminars, online programs, and self-help materials; and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Supportive environments, including workplace policies to encourage healthy lifestyles, healthy eating, increased physical activity, and improved mental health.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Once program funding becomes available, eligible employers may submit a grant application to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Additional guidance is expected from the HHS regarding the application process and the necessary funding for such a program.</p>
