      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Exempted Plans</h2><p class="p">Exempted plans are exempt from certain provisions of the ACA. To maintain exempted status, a plan must meet the following criteria:</p>
<ol class="concept">
            <li><span class="li">The plan was in existence on March 23, 2010, the date the ACA was enacted; and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The plan has not made any <span class="q">“significant changes”</span> since March 23, 2010.</span></li>

         </ol>
<p class="p">Some of the provisions of the ACA in which exempted plans are exempt include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The requirement to cover essential benefits </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">100% preventive care coverage </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The requirement to allow parents to choose participating pediatricians as primary care providers for their children </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The requirement to permit women to see OB-GYNs without a referral </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Providing emergency services that are the same in and out of network </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A prohibition against having eligibility rules that discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A requirement to establish an appeals process for coverage determinations and claims </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Rules on cost sharing and related out-of-pocket maximums </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Coverage for individuals who participate in clinical trials</span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><span class="q">“Significant Changes”</span>:</h2><p class="p">The ACA allows plans to make routine changes without losing exempted status. However, plans will lose their status if <span class="q">“significant changes”</span> are made. These changes include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Significantly cutting or reducing benefits. For example, if a plan decides to no longer cover care for people with diabetes, cystic fibrosis, or HIV/AIDS.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Raising co-insurance charges. Typically, co-insurance requires a patient to pay a fixed percentage of a charge (for example, 20% of a hospital bill). Exempted plans cannot increase this percentage.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Significantly raising co-payment charges. Compared with the copayments in effect on March 23, 2010, exempted plans will be able to increase those co-pays by no more than the greater of $5 (adjusted annually for medical inflation) or a percentage equal to medical inflation plus 15 percentage points. As an example, under this requirement, if a plan raises its copayment from $30 to $50 over the next 2 years, it will lose its status.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Significantly raising deductibles. Compared with the deductible required as of March 23, 2010, exempted plans can only increase deductibles by a percentage equal to medical inflation plus 15 percentage points.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Significantly lowering employer contributions. Exempted plans cannot decrease the percent of premiums the employer pays by more than 5 percentage points. For example, these plans are not permitted to decrease their own share and increase the employees' share of the premium from 15% to 25%.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Adding or tightening an annual limit. To retain their status as exempted, plans cannot tighten any annual dollar limit in place as of March 23, 2010. Moreover, plans that do not have an annual dollar limit cannot add a new one unless they are replacing a lifetime dollar limit with an annual dollar limit that is at least as high as the lifetime limit (which is more protective of high-cost enrollees).</span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Recordkeeping Requirements:</h2><p class="p">Exempted plans must include a statement in their plan documents stating that the health plan is exempted. They must also maintain records documenting that the coverage was established prior to March 23, 2010. These records must be made available upon request.</p>
