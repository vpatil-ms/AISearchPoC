      <p class="p">The ACA generally requires all Americans to have health coverage and for certain employers
         to offer group health coverage to their employees. Those that do not may be subject to a
         penalty.</p>

      <section class="section" id="utg1672727981727__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Individual Mandate:</h2><p class="p">The ACA requires most individuals to be enrolled in a health insurance plan. Individuals are required to maintain minimum essential coverage for themselves and their dependents. Individuals may choose to purchase coverage through their employer, if available, or through state-run Health Insurance Marketplaces.</p>
<p class="p">If individuals are not enrolled in minimum essential coverage, they may be required to pay a tax. Exemptions are available to those with an income below 100% of the poverty level.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="utg1672727981727__section_N10050_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employer Mandate (<span class="q">“Shared Responsibility”</span>):</h2><p class="p">Beginning in 2015 (see Employer Mandate Transition Relief in 2015 below), employers with at least 50 full-time and full-time equivalent (FTE) employees ( see Determining Number of Full-Time/FTEs) must offer full-time employees minimum essential coverage that is deemed affordable, or face a penalty.</p>
<p class="p">To avoid penalties, minimum essential coverage must generally be offered to full-time employees (and their children under 26) and must be affordable (In 2019, the cost of self-only coverage is no more than 9.86% of the employee's annual household income; In 2020, no more than 9.76%) and provide minimal actuarial value (the plan is designed to pay, on average, at least 60% of covered expenses).</p>

      <section class="section" id="utg1672727981727__section_N10061_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employer Mandate Transition Relief in 2015:</h2><p class="p">Pursuant to IRS regulations issued on February 10, 2014, transition relief is generally available through 2015 for employers with 50-99 full-time and FTE employees, provided that they meet the requirements outlined below. These employers will not be subject to the employer mandate until 2016. In order to be eligible, employers must:</p>
<p class="p">Employ an average of at least 50 full-time and FTE employees, but fewer than 100 full-time and FTE employees, during 2014;</p>
<p class="p">Not reduce the size of its workforce or the overall hours of service of its employees, between February 9, 2014 and December 31, 2014;</p>
<p class="p">Not eliminate or materially reduce previously offered health coverage during the coverage maintenance period (for calendar year plans, this period is February 9, 2014, through December 31, 2015; for non-calendar year plans, the period is February 9, 2014, through the last day of the plan year that begins in 2015); and</p>
<p class="p">Certify that they meet the first three eligibility requirements stated above.</p>
<p class="p">If an employer with 50-99 full-time and FTE employees does not meet the requirements above, they may be required to comply with the employer mandate beginning in 2015, rather than in 2016. Employers are encouraged to seek legal counsel when determining their eligibility for transition relief.</p>
<p class="p">Note (for employers with 100 or more FTEs): Employers with 100 or more full-time and FTE employees were required to comply with the employer mandate beginning in 2015. For 2015 only, employers with 100 or more employees must offer coverage to 70% or more of their full-time employees versus the 95% required in 2016. Additionally, in 2015 only, employers with 100 or more full-time employees will not be required to offer coverage to employees' dependents as long as the employer is taking steps to arrange such coverage to begin in 2016.</p>

      <section class="section" id="utg1672727981727__section_N1007D_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employer Penalties:</h2><p class="p">If a covered employer fails to offer minimum essential coverage that is affordable and the following conditions are met, then the employer will be subject to a penalty:</p>
<p class="p">At least one full-time employee purchases coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace; AND</p>
<p class="p">That employee is eligible for, and receives, a Federal premium tax credit in order to subsidize the cost of their coverage.</p>
<div class="note note" id="utg1672727981727__note_N1008C_N1007D_N1003C_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employees with household income up to 400% above the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) will be eligible to receive the Federal Tax Credit. For 2016, the FPL is $24,250 for a family of four, meaning that an employee with a family of four earning less than $97,000 may be eligible for a Federal Tax Credit if they enrolled in coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. (Note: the FPL is indexed for inflation).</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Penalties differ depending on what part of the employer mandate provision the employer fails to meet. Note: The penalties are subject to annual adjustment for inflation. The penalties discussed below are the amounts for 2016.</p>
<p class="p">Penalty 1:</p>
<p class="p">If the employer fails to offer coverage to 95% or more of its full-time employees (and their dependents) AND the two conditions noted above are met, the employer may face an annual assessment of up to $2,160 for each full-time employee, excluding the first 30 full-time employees.</p>
<p class="p">Penalty 2:</p>
<p class="p">If the employer offers coverage to 95% or more of its full-time employees (and their dependents), but such coverage fails the minimum value or affordability test AND the two conditions noted above are met, the employer may face an annual assessment that is equal to the lesser of:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">$3,240 for each full-time employee that receives subsidized coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace; or</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">$2,160 for each full-time employee, excluding the first 30 full-time employees.</span></li>
