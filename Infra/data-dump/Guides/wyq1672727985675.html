      <section class="section" id="wyq1672727985675__section_N10049_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Problem: The candidate's answers are too brief.</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Solution:</span> While brief answers are sometimes appropriate during an
            interview, when a candidate is too brief, they may not be giving you the information you
            need to make a valuable assessment of their skills and experience. To encourage a
            candidate to elaborate, ask them to explain why they answered a question in a particular
            way. Or try using the <span class="q">“echo”</span> technique: simply repeat what the candidate has just
            said, but use an inquisitive tone. For example, if a candidate says, <span class="q">“I left my last
               job because it didn't challenge me,”</span> say, "You left because it didn't challenge
            you?" The candidate should recognize that you would like more information. You can also
            use non-verbal signals to encourage a candidate to say more. Nod your head as the
            candidate answers your questions and allow an occasional silence to follow a response.
            The candidate is likely to naturally fill the gap with more information.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wyq1672727985675__section_N1005F_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Problem: The candidate's answers are long-winded.</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Solution:</span> By contrast, you may meet an interviewee who rambles,
            especially when asked open-ended questions. To address this, ask more targeted
            questions. For instance, instead of asking: <span class="q">“tell me about yourself,”</span> try asking
            the candidate to describe an average day in their current or previous role, or about
            their experience and background as it relates to the position for which they are
            applying.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wyq1672727985675__section_N10071_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Problem: The candidate seems to be evading a question.</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Solution:</span> In some cases, a candidate may avoid the question
            entirely. If a candidate fails to answer an important question, ask the question again.
            If they still do not answer, try asking the question in a different way. For instance,
            if you ask the candidate to share a job-related weakness, but they only share positive
            attributes, try re-wording the question. Ask the candidate instead to share some areas
            they would like to focus on from a professional development standpoint.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wyq1672727985675__section_N1007F_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Problem: The interviewer is doing most of talking.</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Solution:</span> During an interview, allow the candidate to do most of
            the talking. At the start of the interview, give the candidate a brief overview of the
            company and the position, and then dive right into your list of prepared questions. Work
            with co-workers, managers, or human resources to develop a strong list of open-ended and
            targeted questions to ask each candidate. When the candidate asks questions, keep your
            answers brief and to the point.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wyq1672727985675__section_N1008D_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Problem: The candidate's responses seem canned.</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Solution:</span> Some candidates may seem like they are only telling you
            what they think you want to hear. If a candidate seems overly prepared and has rehearsed
            responses, try asking hypothetical questions to elicit more candid answers. For
            instance, present the candidate with a scenario they might face in the prospective job
            and ask them how they would handle it.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wyq1672727985675__section_N1009B_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Problem: The candidate uses <span class="q">“we”</span> when answering questions.</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Solution:</span> If a candidate answers a question by using <span class="q">“we”</span>
            instead of <span class="q">“I,”</span> they may be referring to work completed with other team members, or
            overstating their accomplishments. In such cases, ask follow-up questions. For example,
            if a candidate says: "we increased sales by 20 percent," you could ask how the candidate
            specifically contributed to increasing sales.</p>
