      <p class="p">Depending on the circumstances, eligible employees are entitled to 12 or 26 weeks of
         job-protected leave in a one year period. The reasons for leave and the maximum duration
         are outlined below.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xsu1672727981633__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Leave for Pregnancy, Birth, Adoption or Foster Care:</h2><p class="p">Both parents are entitled to FMLA leave for the birth of a child or the placement of a son or daughter in the employee's care following adoption or a foster arrangement. An employee is eligible to take up to 12 weeks of leave within one year of the child's date of birth or placement.</p>
<p class="p">Intermittent or reduced schedule leave: An eligible employee may use intermittent leave (leave
            used in separate blocks of time for a single qualifying reason) or reduced schedule
            leave (a type of intermittent leave that results in a change to an employee's usual
            number of work hours per day or per week) following the birth or placement of a child
            only if the employer agrees. </p>

      <section class="section" id="xsu1672727981633__section_N1005A_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Leave for Serious Health Condition:</h2><p class="p">Eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in a one year period for their own serious health condition or to care for the employee's spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition. A serious health condition is defined as an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Any period of incapacity or treatment connected with inpatient care (an overnight stay) in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A period of incapacity requiring absence of more than three calendar days from work, school, or other regular daily activities that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Any period of incapacity or treatment for a chronic serious health condition;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A period of incapacity that is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective; or</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Any absence to receive multiple treatments (including any period of recovery from such treatments) by a health care provider for a condition that likely would result in incapacity of more than three consecutive days if left untreated.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Leave for this purpose may be taken on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis.</p>
<p class="p">Spouses who work for the same employer: Spouses who are eligible for FMLA leave and are employed by the same employer may be limited to a combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month period for the employee's parent with a serious health condition, for the birth or placement of a child.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xsu1672727981633__section_N10085_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Leave for a Qualifying Exigency:</h2><p class="p">Eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for qualifying exigencies arising when the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is on covered active duty, or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty in a foreign country. Qualifying exigency leave is intended to allow eligible employees to take FMLA leave to address common issues that arise when a covered military member is deployed, such as attending military-sponsored functions, making appropriate financial and legal arrangements, and arranging for alternative childcare.</p>
<p class="p">FMLA leave may be taken intermittently for a qualifying exigency arising out of the covered active duty status or call to covered active duty of a covered military member.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xsu1672727981633__section_N10092_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Military Caregiver Leave:</h2><p class="p">A covered employer must grant an eligible employee up to 26 weeks of unpaid leave in a 12-month period to care for a covered service-member with a serious injury or illness. An employee can take military caregiver leave if they are a spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered service member with a serious injury or illness.</p>
<p class="p">The <span class="q">“single 12-month period”</span> for leave to care for a covered service-member with a serious injury or illness begins on the first day the employee takes leave for this reason and ends 12 months later, regardless of the 12 month period established by the employer for purposes of tracking other types of FMLA leave (see the Tracking Leave section for more information on this topic). An eligible employee is limited to a combined total of 26 workweeks of leave for any FMLA-qualifying reason during the <span class="q">“single 12-month period.”</span></p>
<p class="p">Military caregiver leave may be taken intermittently whenever medically necessary to care for a covered service-member with a serious injury or illness. When leave is needed for planned medical treatment, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment to avoid unduly disrupting the employer's operations.</p>
