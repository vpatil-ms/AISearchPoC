<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Post E-Verify Notices: Employers that use E-Verify must post the Right to Work and E-Verify Participation notices in a prominent place that is clearly visible to prospective employees.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Completing the I-9 Form is a pre-requisite: Even though you are verifying employment eligibility using the E-Verify system, you are still required to complete and retain an I-9 Form for each employee. This must be done before initiating an E-Verify query.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">May not be used prior to acceptance of job offer: E-Verify may only be used after an employee has accepted employment and has completed the I-9 Form. However, E-Verify queries must be initiated no later than 3 business days after the employee's first day of work for pay. Additionally, you may not use E-Verify on current employees unless you are a government contractor required to do so as part of the contract.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Must be used consistently: If you use E-Verify, you must generally use it consistently for all new hires. Use of the system may never be on a selective basis.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Follow appropriate TNC procedures: When a Tentative Nonconfirmation (TNC) result is returned, you must notify the employee in private and provide them with a written notice. You must allow the employee to contest the finding and may not take any adverse action against the employee if they choose to contest the results. You must refer contesting employees to the Social Security Administration or the Department of Homeland Security and should check the E-Verify system periodically to see if either agency has provided a final case status.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Recordkeeping: Employers using E-Verify must either record the E-Verify case number on the employee's I-9 Form or print the case details and keep it on file with the employee's I-9 Form. </span></li>

         </ul>
