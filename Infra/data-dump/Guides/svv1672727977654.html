<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Prepare:</span> Set aside adequate time prior to the
               interview to review the candidate's application materials. If you have conducted a
               phone or video interview, review any notes you made during your discussion with the
               applicant. After reviewing these materials, prepare a list of relevant interview
               questions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Be consistent:</span> Consistency is important for
               demonstrating that your interview process is applied fairly. This means all
               candidates for a particular position should be asked the same core set of
               questions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Ask only job-related questions:</span> Federal, state, and
               local laws protect employees and job applicants from discrimination on the basis of
               race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information,
               and military status, among other characteristics. Only ask job-related questions and
               avoid questions that could, directly or indirectly, identify the candidate as a
               member of a protected group. If an applicant voluntarily offers information about
               their protected status, redirect the interview to elicit job-related information that
               can help assess whether the candidate is qualified for the job and do not use the
               protected information when making employment decisions. Train supervisors and others
               who conduct interviews to ask questions in accordance with the law and company
               policy.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Ask open-ended questions:</span> Closed-ended questions can
               be answered with a simple yes or no and are often leading questions (the appropriate
               answer can be determined by the question itself). Open-ended questions are more
               likely to elicit valuable job-related information by encouraging applicants to give a
               fuller answer based on their own knowledge, experience, and beliefs. Instead of
               asking a closed-ended question such as <span class="q">“are you adept at handling disputes between
                  employees?”</span> you may want to ask the candidate to describe a situation in which
               they had to handle a workplace dispute in the past.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Consider behavioral based questioning:</span> Behavioral
               questions ask candidates to share past experiences handling specific work challenges;
               those they'll likely encounter working for you. When asking behavioral questions, ask
               the candidate to provide details concerning the situation, the action they took, and
               the end result. For example, a behavioral-based question for a customer service
               representative may be <span class="q">“tell me about a time when you received a call from an irate
                  customer and how you handled it.”</span> A question for a managerial candidate may be
                  <span class="q">“describe a situation in which two employees were having a dispute and how you
                  handled it.”</span> Follow-up questions are an important component to behavioral-based
               interviews. For example, if the candidate repeatedly uses "we," the interviewer
               should ask about their specific role in addressing the work challenge. Another
               follow-up question to consider is asking why the candidate chose a particular course
               of action over others, which can provide insight into their motivations, thought
               process, and problem-solving ability. Follow-up questions can also help the
               interviewer determine the authenticity of the information provided by the
               candidate.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Take notes:</span> Jot down notes during the interview so
               that you can recall valuable information when it comes time to compare candidates and
               ultimately make a hiring decision. Keep notes factual and avoid expressing opinions
               or including information that is unrelated to the job, even if voluntarily disclosed
               by the applicant.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Evaluate responses:</span> After the interview, promptly
               review responses. Evaluate relevance to the question asked and the candidate's
               effectiveness in handling the work challenge. </span></li>
