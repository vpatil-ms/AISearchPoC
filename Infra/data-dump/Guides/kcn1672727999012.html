      <p class="p">The definition of applicant is important because many of the protections and recordkeeping
         requirements under EEO laws are triggered when an individual becomes an applicant. The
         definition is also important when employers are evaluating whether hiring practices are
         discriminatory toward any protected group.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kcn1672727999012__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The EEOC's definition of applicant states:</h2><p class="p"><span class="q">“The precise definition of the term 'applicant' depends upon the user's recruitment and selection procedures. The concept of an applicant is that of a person who has indicated an interest in being considered for hiring, promotion, or other employment opportunities. This interest might be expressed by completing an application form, or might be expressed orally, depending on the employer's practice.”</span></p>
<p class="p">In 2004, the EEOC considered guidance designed to clarify the definition of applicant in the context of the Internet and related electronic technologies. The EEOC proposed the guidance because of the increasing number of job seekers who express interest using electronic vehicles such as the Internet and e-mail. However, the EEOC never finalized the guidance, so the above definition is the one on which the EEOC continues to rely.</p>
<p class="p">The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) has approved a definition of Internet applicant, but it applies to federal contractors and subcontractors only. The OFCCP is responsible for enforcement of affirmative action and EEO laws and regulations related to federal contractors. Under the OFCCP definition, an Internet applicant is someone who:</p>
<p class="p">Has submitted an expression of interest in employment through the Internet or similar technology </p>
<p class="p">The employer has considered as a job seeker for a particular open position </p>
<p class="p">Expresses interest that indicates he or she possesses the advertised, basic qualifications for the position </p>
<p class="p">Did not subsequently indicate no longer having an interest in employment in that position</p>
<p class="p">Employers should have a clearly written policy that includes a definition of an applicant for their supervisors, document all forms of job searches and basic qualifications, and be consistent with how people are recruited and hired. Anyone involved in the application process must be trained on the company's policy and the changes due to electronic hiring.</p>
