A Plan Administrator can elect to measure the maximum period of COBRA continuation coverage from the date coverage is lost. A group health plan, however, may provide longer periods of coverage beyond the maximum required by COBRA.</p>

<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Second Qualifying Event:</span></p>
<p class="p">An 18-month extension may be available to qualified beneficiaries (who are the spouse or child of a covered employee) receiving an 18-month maximum period of COBRA continuation coverage (giving a total maximum period of up to 36 months of COBRA continuation coverage) if the qualified beneficiaries experience a second qualifying event that is: death of the covered employee, divorce or legal separation of the covered employee and spouse, covered employee's Medicare entitlement, or loss of dependent child status under the plan.</p>
