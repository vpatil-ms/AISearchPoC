      <section class="section" id="zcp1672727979304__section_lzg_5nv_cwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Section 1:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">To complete this section, the employee must provide basic demographic information,
            including their name, address, date of birth, and citizenship status. If the employee is
            a lawful permanent resident or an alien authorized to work in the U.S., they must also
            provide their alien number and/or admission number. There is also a space for the
            employee to enter their Social Security Number (SSN), email address and telephone
            number. Providing this information is voluntary. However, if you participate in the
            E-Verify program, the employee's SSN is required in order to run an E-Verify query (see
            the E-Verify section of this Guide for more information). In Section 1, the employee
            must also attest to their employment authorization.</p>

         <p class="p">If an employee is unable to complete Section 1 without assistance or if the employee
            needs the form translated, someone may assist them. The preparer or translator must read
            the form to the employee, assist them in completing Section 1 and have the employee sign
            or mark the form in the appropriate place. The preparer or translator must then complete
            the Preparer and/or Translator Certification Block found within Section 1 of the
            form.</p>

         <p class="p">As the employer, you are responsible for reviewing the information and ensuring
            employees (and their preparer/translators, if applicable) fully and properly completed
            Section 1.</p>

         <p class="p">Deadline: Section 1 must be completed by the end of the employee's first day of work for
            pay.</p>

      </section>

      <section class="section" id="zcp1672727979304__section_nzk_5nv_cwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Section 2:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">To complete Section 2, the employee must present certain identity and employment
            authorization documents. You may only accept original unexpired documents from the list
            of acceptable documents found on the last page of the form (see Form I-9: Acceptable
            Documents).</p>

         <p class="p">In general, the employee must be physically present during the examination of the
            documents. If the document(s) reasonably appears to be genuine and to relate to the
            employee, enter the document name, issuing authority, the document number and expiration
            date in the space provided. You or your authorized representative must also sign this
            section of the form, attesting that you have reviewed the documents provided and that
            they appear to be authentic and relate to the individual presenting them. The person who
            examines the documents must be the same person who signs Section 2.</p>

         <p class="p">Deadline: This section of the form must be completed within 3 business days of the
            employee's start date. However, for new employees who will work fewer than three
            business days, Section 1 and Section 2 must be fully completed by the employee's first
            day of work for pay.</p>

      <section class="section" id="zcp1672727979304__section_vkl_5nv_cwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Section 3:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">This section of the form is reserved for re-verification, updates, and rehires.
            Employers must complete Section 3 when an employee's work authorization document expires
            or when rehiring an employee (depending on how much time has passed since they initially
            completed the form). The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) also
            recommends that employers note name changes in this section. For more information on
            completing Section 3, see the Form I-9: Updates and Re-Verification section of this
            Guide.</p>
