      <p class="p">In 2009, the ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA) made a number of significant changes to the ADA's
         definition of <span class="q">“disability.”</span> These changes made it easier for individuals seeking
         protection under the ADA to establish that they have a disability. Under the ADAAA, the
         broadened definition of <span class="q">“disability”</span> is:</p>

      <p class="p">A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities
            (<span class="q">“actual disability”</span> prong); or</p>

      <p class="p">A record of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited a major life
         activity (<span class="q">“record of”</span> prong); or</p>

      <p class="p">When a covered entity takes an action prohibited by the ADA because of an actual or
         perceived impairment that is not both transitory and minor (the <span class="q">“regarded as”</span>
         prong).</p>

      <p class="p">See below for more information on each of these components.</p>

      <section class="section" id="mdy1672727984310__section_N10067_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Physical or Mental Impairment:</h2><p class="p">A <span class="q">“physical or mental impairment”</span> is any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more body systems, such as neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, immune, circulatory, hemic, lymphatic, skin and endocrine. They also cover any mental or psychological disorder, such as intellectual disability, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities.</p>

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Applying the term <span class="q">“substantially limits”</span> broadly, in favor of expansive coverage.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An impairment is a disability if it substantially limits an individual from performing a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population. An impairment does not need to prevent, or significantly restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be substantially limiting.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The determination of disability should not require extensive analysis.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity requires an individualized assessment and may involve scientific, medical, or statistical evidence, if appropriate.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">With the exception of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses, the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made without regard to the beneficial effects of mitigating measures.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An impairment that is episodic (such as epilepsy) or in remission (such as cancer) meets the definition of disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An impairment does not have to last for more than six months in order to be considered substantially limiting.</span></li>

<p class="p">In addition, major life activities include the operation of major bodily functions, such as functions of the immune system, special sense organs and skin, normal cell growth, digestive, genitourinary, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, cardiovascular, endocrine, hemic, lymphatic, musculoskeletal, and reproductive functions. Major bodily functions also include the operation of an individual organ within a body system (e.g., the operation of the kidney, liver, or pancreas).</p>

      <section class="section" id="mdy1672727984310__section_N100AF_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Mitigating Measures:</h2><p class="p">Mitigating measures eliminate or reduce the symptoms or impact of an impairment. The positive effects from an individual's use of mitigating measures other than ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses must be ignored in determining if an impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Instead, the determination of disability must focus on whether the individual would be substantially limited in performing a major life activity without the mitigating measure. This may mean focusing on the extent of limitations prior to use of a mitigating measure or on what would happen if the individual ceased using it.</p>
<p class="p">Some examples of mitigating measures include: medication, medical equipment and devices, prosthetic limbs, low vision devices ( e.g., devices that magnify a visual image), hearing aids, mobility devices, oxygen therapy equipment, use of assistive technology, reasonable accommodations, learned behavioral or adaptive neurological modifications, psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, and physical therapy.</p>
