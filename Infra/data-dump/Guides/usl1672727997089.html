      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Coordination with Other Laws</h2><p class="p">COBRA interacts with several other federal benefits-related laws, including the Family and Medical Leave Act of (FMLA) and the Affordable Care Act (ACA).</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">FMLA:</h2><p class="p">FMLA requires covered employers (those with 50 or more employees) to maintain coverage under any group health plan for an employee on FMLA leave under the same conditions coverage would have been provided if the employee had continued working. Group health coverage that is provided during a leave of absence is not COBRA continuation coverage, and taking FMLA leave is not a qualifying event under COBRA. A COBRA qualifying event may occur, however, when an employer's obligation to maintain health benefits under FMLA ceases, such as when an employee taking FMLA leave decides not to return to work.</p>
<div class="note note"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Your state may have its own family and medical leave law. Check your state requirements to ensure compliance.</p>
</div>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">ACA:</h2><p class="p">ACA requires group health plans, including coverage provided under COBRA, to comply with various insurance reforms, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Providing dependent child coverage to age 26</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prohibiting limits or exclusions from coverage for preexisting conditions</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Banning lifetime or annual dollar limits on coverage for essential health benefits</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Providing coverage for certain preventive services without cost sharing </span></li>
