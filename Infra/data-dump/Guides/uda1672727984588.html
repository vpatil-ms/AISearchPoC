      <p class="p">Once you have decided on the form of disciplinary action you will take, conduct the
         disciplinary meeting. Here are some general guidelines and best practices:</p>

      <section class="section" id="uda1672727984588__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Keep it private.</h2><p class="p">Hold the meeting in a private location, away from co-workers.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uda1672727984588__section_N1004D_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Have a witness.</h2><p class="p">Have the employee's manager conduct the meeting with another company representative present as a witness.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uda1672727984588__section_N10057_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Be straightforward.</h2><p class="p">While it may be helpful to remind the employee of their strengths, remember the purpose of the disciplinary meeting is to pinpoint and improve upon poor performance or conduct. To accomplish this goal, tell the employee exactly what the problem is, what steps they must take to correct it, and the consequences of failing to do so.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uda1672727984588__section_N10061_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Remain calm.</h2><p class="p">The employee may respond with anger, intimidation, complaints, blame, silence or an unwillingness to acknowledge the problem. Remain calm, regardless of the employee's reaction.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uda1672727984588__section_N1006B_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Be respectful.</h2><p class="p">Let the employee know that you want them to improve and that you are willing to help. Provide the employee with an opportunity to respond and make sure to listen to their concerns. Remember to be sensitive to the employee's feelings and be constructive in your use of criticism.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uda1672727984588__section_N10075_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Explain impact to the company.</h2><p class="p">By explaining how an employee's misconduct or performance affects the company, you are focusing attention on the welfare of the business, rather than on the employee's personal attributes.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uda1672727984588__section_N1007F_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Work with the employee to find a solution.</h2><p class="p">Explain that you are trying to help the employee improve their performance or behavior. This approach allows the employee to view the situation as an opportunity to succeed, instead of feeling they have been set up for failure.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uda1672727984588__section_N10089_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">State the consequences.</h2><p class="p">Be clear on the consequences if the employee fails to improve. At the conclusion of the meeting, confirm that the employee has fully understood the purpose of the meeting and the expectations for improvement.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uda1672727984588__section_N10093_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Provide employees with an opportunity to comment.</h2><p class="p">Give employees the opportunity to comment and ask them to acknowledge the discussion in writing. While the employee may not necessarily agree with the disciplinary action, their acknowledgment serves to document that the employee has received and reviewed the notice of disciplinary action and cannot later allege that they were unaware of the problem.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="uda1672727984588__section_N1009D_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Follow-up.</h2><p class="p">After the meeting, follow up with the employee and look for improvements in performance or behavior. If their performance has not improved, further disciplinary action may be necessary.</p>
