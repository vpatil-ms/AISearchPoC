      <section class="section" id="cwy1672727989683__section_N1003F_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Jury Duty Leave</h2><p class="p">Jury duty is mandatory and employers are prohibited from disciplining or otherwise retaliating against employees who serve on a jury or who are summoned for jury duty. When an employee is called upon to serve, consider the following guidelines:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Advance notice.</span> Ask employees to provide as much
               advance notice as possible when they are called upon to serve. This can help you make
               scheduling adjustments to accommodate the employee's absence.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Verification.</span> Some employers choose to require
               employees to provide verification of jury service. Some states have created online
               tools to help employers verify jury service. If you decide to implement a
               verification process, apply it consistently to all employees who are called upon to
               serve.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Early release.</span> Many employees who receive a jury
               summons aren't selected to serve and others may be released early. Provide employees
               with specific instructions for returning to work under these circumstances. For
               example, some employers require employees to report to work if they are released from
               service with at least four hours remaining in their shift.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Scheduling considerations.</span> While it is generally
               permissible to request employees to return to work following an early release, some
               states prohibit employers from requiring an employee who has served a full day of
               jury duty to then work a full shift (for example, a night shift). Make sure your
               policy complies with applicable state law.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Pay.</span> Some states require employers to pay non-exempt
               employees for time spent serving as a juror. Of the states that impose a pay
               requirement, some permit the employer to pay the difference between payments received
               for serving as a juror and the employee's regular wages. Note: Exempt employees must
               receive their full salary (minus jury or witness payments), unless the employee is
               out for a full workweek.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Carefully review all applicable laws and make sure your policies and procedures comply.</p>
