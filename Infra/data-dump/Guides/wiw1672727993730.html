Both laws prohibit wage discrimination based on gender, but Title VII is more encompassing, since it bars discrimination in all areas of employment, including hiring, firing, and promotions.</p>
<p class="p">The EPA requires more than equal wages. If employees do the same work, they are also entitled to the same fringe benefits, such as insurance coverage and pensions. In addition, all employees <span class="q">“ regardless of gender ”</span> who perform equal work must receive equal forms of compensation other than wages, including vacation time, profit sharing and bonuses.</p>
<p class="p">Although the EPA protects all employees from gender discrimination in pay rates, it was passed to help alleviate wage disparity between men and women workers as a result of sex discrimination. This law is almost always applied to situations in which women are paid less than men for equal work.</p>

<ol class="concept">
            <li><span class="li">Working in the same place </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Doing equal work </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Receiving unequal pay</span></li>

         </ol>
<p class="p">The claim will be denied if the employer can show that the wage disparity is legitimate. For instance, the higher earner may have greater seniority or experience.</p>
<p class="p">Businesses should be aware that the jobs do not have to be identical for the courts to consider them equal. The titles or job descriptions may differ between two employees, yet they are actually doing the same work with same responsibilities. Overall, the courts have ruled that two jobs are equal under the EPA when both require equal levels of skill, effort, and responsibility and are performed under similar conditions. Although there appears to be some latitude here, the idea is that even if there is a minor degree of difference in skills and abilities required, the two jobs should probably be considered equal. Difficulties arise when two jobs have the same job descriptions, but one involves several additional duties. It is legal to provide higher pay for these additional duties, but some courts have questioned companies in which the higher-paying jobs with extra duties are consistently filled by workers of one gender.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wiw1672727993730__section_w482ab1b5b5_w483ab1b5_w484ab1"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Rate of Pay versus Total Pay:</h2><p class="p">Confusion may also result from the law stipulating that employers pay workers the same rate, not the same total amount. If one worker earns more than another because of higher productivity, EPA is not violated. For example, a business pays all workers $5 per a certain assembly line item. Susan makes 10 items per hour, and Robert makes 20 items per hour. Thus, Susan earns $50 per hour, and Frank $100. Although they are earning different total amounts, the company is not violating the EPA since it is paying them the same rate. The pay disparity is the result of differing levels of productivity, not gender discrimination.</p>
<p class="p">Disparities in pay can arise in situations, such as when merger pay rates are not yet equalized; when jobs change over time without evaluations taking place and like positions compared; and when jobs are similarly created, but change over time such as full time to part-time.</p>

Pay discrimination is illegal under several federal acts: Equal Pay, Title VII, ADEA and Title I of the ADA. It is important to compare the pay of male and female workers who have been doing the same job over the past year and have the same experience and years of service. The same should be done with different ethnic groups and those having a disability compared to those who do not. If the employer sees any inequity of pay or a trend for people from one group to be favored over another, then further examination must be done. The goal is to be proactive and eliminate any disproportionate pay before any problems arise.</p>
