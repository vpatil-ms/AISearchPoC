            employer may be reluctant to hire the person in case of a subsequent injury on top of
            the earlier condition. In an effort to discourage employers from discriminating against
            applicants who have suffered prior injuries, many states have created a <span class="ph em">second injury fund</span> that pays a certain portion of the
            compensation benefits due to a re-injured employee.</p>
<p class="p">Many employers question whether or not they can be reimbursed from the fund after paying full benefits to a re-injured employee if the employer was unaware of the injury in the first place. Some state courts have ruled that the employee's prior injury must be manifest for the employer to recover from the fund; in other words, the employer must have actual knowledge of the prior injury, or the prior injury must be obvious or officially documented and available to the employer. To avoid any such complications, many employers require that new employees undergo medical examinations prior to being hired.</p>
