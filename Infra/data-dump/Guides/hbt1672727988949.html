      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Medical Certification</h2><p class="p">An employer may require a certification from a healthcare provider when FMLA leave is taken to care for the employee's covered family member with a serious health condition, or due to the employee's own serious health condition. The employee has the responsibility to provide the employer with complete and sufficient certification and failure to do so may result in the denial of FMLA leave.</p>
<p class="p">If you require medical certification, you must give notice of the requirement and identify any consequences for failing to provide adequate certification. In most cases, the employer should make a request that an employee furnish certification at the time the employee gives notice of the need for leave or within five business days. In the case of unforeseen leave, the employer should request certification within five business days of the commencement of leave.</p>
<p class="p">In general, the employee must provide the requested certification within 15 calendar days after the employer's request.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Incomplete Certification:</h2><p class="p">If the employer determines that the certification is incomplete and/or insufficient, the employer must inform the employee and request, in writing, the additional information needed. In general, the employee must be given at least seven calendar days to remedy any deficiency.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">DOL Certification Forms:</h2><p class="p">The Department of Labor (DOL) has developed sample certification forms and it's a best practice to use these forms when requesting medical certification:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Form WH-380-E: Certification of healthcare provider for an employee's serious health condition</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Form WH-380-F: Certification of healthcare provider for a family member's serious health condition</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Form WH-384: Certification of qualifying exigency for military family leave</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Form WH-385: Certification for serious injury or illness of covered service member for military family leave</span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Second and Third Opinions:</h2><p class="p">An employer who has reason to doubt the validity of a medical certification may require the employee to obtain a second opinion at the employer's expense. Pending receipt of the second medical opinion, the employee is provisionally entitled to FMLA.</p>
<p class="p">If the first and second opinions differ, the employer may require the employee to obtain certification from a third healthcare provider, again at the employer's expense. The third opinion is final and binding. A copy of second and/or third opinions must be provided to the employee upon request.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Recertification:</h2><p class="p">Generally, an employer may request recertification for leave taken because of an employee's own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a family member no more than every 30 days and only in connection with an absence by the employee. If the medical certification indicates that the minimum duration of the condition is more than 30 days, an employer must wait until that minimum duration expires before requesting a recertification.</p>
<p class="p">An employer may request recertification in less than 30 days if the:</p>
<ol class="concept">
            <li><span class="li">Employee requests an extension of leave;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Circumstances described by the previous certification have changed significantly; or</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employer receives information that questions the validity of the certification.</span></li>

         </ol>
<p class="p">Employers must give employees at least 15 calendar days to provide the recertification and they cannot request second or third opinions.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Fitness-for-Duty Certification:</h2><p class="p">Under certain circumstances, an employer may require a fitness-for-duty certification from an employee following a leave for the employee's own serious health condition. An employer must apply the policy uniformly and require each similarly situated employee to obtain a fitness-for-duty certification before resuming work.</p>
<div class="note note"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires any medical examination to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
</div>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Contacting Healthcare Providers:</h2><p class="p">In order to protect employee health information, representatives that contact a healthcare provider to obtain a medical certification must be either a human resource professional, leave administrator, or a management official. Under no circumstances may the individual be the employee's direct supervisor. Additionally, these individuals are not permitted to ask for additional information beyond what is required in the certification form.</p>
