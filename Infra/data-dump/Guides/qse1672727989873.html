      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Election Procedures</h2><p class="p">COBRA requires group health plans to give qualified beneficiaries an election period, of at least 60 days, during which they can decide whether to elect COBRA continuation coverage. This period starts beginning from the later of the date the election notice is provided, or the date on which the qualified beneficiary would otherwise lose coverage under the group health plan due to the qualifying event.</p>
<p class="p">Each qualified beneficiary must be given an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. This means that when several individuals (such as a covered employee, his or her spouse, and their dependent children) become qualified beneficiaries due to the same qualifying event, each individual can make their own election choice.</p>
<p class="p">If a qualified beneficiary waives COBRA continuation coverage during the election period, he or she must be permitted to later revoke the waiver of coverage and elect COBRA continuation coverage, as long as the revocation is done before the end of the election period.</p>
