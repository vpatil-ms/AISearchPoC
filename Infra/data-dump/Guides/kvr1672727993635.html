      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">ADA: Leave as a Reasonable Accommodation</h2><p class="p">Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and many state laws, employers cannot discriminate against individuals on the basis of disability and may be required to provide a reasonable accommodation so that individuals with disabilities can perform the essential functions of their job.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reasonable Accommodation:</h2><p class="p">Generally, a reasonable accommodation is a change in the work environment or in the way work is customarily done that enables an individual to perform the essential functions of their job and enjoy equal employment opportunities.</p>
<p class="p">Depending on the circumstances, paid or unpaid leave may be a reasonable accommodation. Have a dialogue with the employee to determine if a leave of absence, or other accommodation, would effectively remove the workplace barrier. Document all conversations with the employee and retain the documentation in a separate confidential file. Remember, the accommodation chosen does not necessarily need to be the one the employee asks for initially. Work together to find an appropriate accommodation and document not only the accommodation selected, but also the accommodations rejected and the reasons for why they were not implemented.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Undue Hardship:</h2><p class="p">A reasonable accommodation is not required if it would impose an undue hardship on the business. An undue hardship is generally considered a significant financial or operational burden.</p>
