Failure to do so may result in a penalty (see Health Insurance Mandate for more information on these penalties). For purposes of the ACA's employer mandate, an ALE is defined as a business that averaged 50 or more full-time and full-time equivalent (FTE) employees in the previous calendar year.</p>
<p class="p">Employers must consider all employees when determining the number of FTEs since multiple part-time employees or seasonal workers may equal an FTE (note that special rules apply for purposes of counting seasonal workers). Employees of controlled groups must also be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="p">When determining whether a business is subject to the employer mandate provisions, two calculations must be made:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Determining the number of full-time employees; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Determining the number of FTEs</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">If the sum of these calculations equals 50 or more, the employer is subject to the employer mandate provisions.</p>

For the FTE calculation, the monthly hours of part-time employees are divided by 120. Note: If the part-time employee works more than 120 hours but less than 130 hours during the month, only 120 hours must be included in the calculation. The FTE calculation is done by adding all of the hours worked by part-time employees (those working less than 30 hours per week) in a month and dividing by 120.</p>
<p class="p">Example: An employer has 3 part-time employees each working 20 hours per week:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Total hours worked per month: 240 hours </span></li>
