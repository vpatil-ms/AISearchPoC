<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Eligibility.</span> Determine who is eligible for leave (such
               as, full-time and/or part-time employees) and how long employees must work for the
               company before they are eligible.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Reasons for leave.</span> Clearly state under what
               circumstances employees can take leave. If the policy applies to family members,
               define who qualifies as a covered family member.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Length of leave.</span> Indicate how much time employees can
               use for each covered purpose and whether the leave has to be taken all at once or if
               it can be taken on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Pay.</span> Clearly explain whether the leave is paid or
               unpaid and/or whether employees can use their accrued paid time off during the
               leave.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Advance notice.</span> Most leave laws require employees to
               provide advance notice when the need for leave is foreseeable. When the leave is not
               foreseeable, generally employees must provide notice as soon as possible.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Leave requests.</span> Require employees to submit leave
               requests, including the reason for leave and expected duration, in writing. Employers
               should provide approvals and denials of leave in writing as well. Due to the nature
               of the information, maintain this documentation and other leave documentation (which
               may be required to be retained under the law), in a confidential file separate from
               the employee's personnel file.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Medical certification.</span> Employers may want to request
               medical certification or other documentation validating the need for, and duration
               of, leave. Several leave laws have specific rules for making these types of requests,
               so be sure to review your applicable law to ensure compliance.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Health insurance continuation.</span> Indicate whether the
               employee may continue health, dental, and other benefits during leave (many leave
               laws require continuation of such benefits). If employees are able to continue
               benefits during the leave, provide instructions for how employees are expected to
               make payments for their share of the premiums. Also, consider whether employees on
               leave will continue to accrue vacation or other paid time off.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Reinstatement.</span> Most leave laws require employees to be
               reinstated to the same or comparable position following leave. Provide employees with
               instructions for notifying you when they're expected to return to work.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Anti-retaliation.</span> Many laws prohibit employers from
               retaliating against employees for taking a job-protected leave of absence or
               exercising their rights under the law(s). Instruct managers that any form of
               retaliation will not be tolerated. Also, train managers on your leave policies and
               procedures to ensure they follow applicable laws consistently and appropriately
               respond to leave requests. For example, some laws require employers to provide all
               employees, or employees requesting leave, with written notices concerning their leave
               rights.</span></li>
