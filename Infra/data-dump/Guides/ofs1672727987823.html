         <p class="p">Generally, the ADA permits employers to conduct pre-hire medical
            examinations after an offer of employment has been made and <span class="ph em">after</span> all potentially disqualifying steps of the pre-employment process have
            been completed, provided that all new employees in the same type of job are subject to
            the exam. The results must be kept confidential and the exam must be job-related.</p>

         <p class="p">If an employee requests an accommodation, employers may ask the employee
            for reasonable medical documentation only if the disability or the need for an
            accommodation isn't obvious. In such cases, employers may only ask for information that
            is necessary to process the accommodation request. This means that an employer may seek
            information needed to establish that the individual has a disability, and that the
            disability creates functional limitations that require a reasonable accommodation.
            However, the employer may not ask for an employee's complete medical file.</p>

            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Medical records must be kept in confidential files, separate from the
               employee's personnel file.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ofs1672727987823__section_N10061_N10044_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Recordkeeping Requirements:</h2><p class="p">Under the ADA, employers must retain records related to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Hiring (e.g., resumes, application forms and interview notes) </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Requests for reasonable accommodation </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Promotion, demotion, transfer, lay-off or termination </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Rates of pay or other terms of compensation </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Selection for training</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Employers must retain these records for one year after making the record or taking the action (whichever occurs later). If a discrimination complaint is filed or an action is brought by the EEOC, an employer must save all personnel records related to the complaint until its final disposition.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ofs1672727987823__section_N10085_N10044_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Job Descriptions:</h2><p class="p">While not required by the ADA, it is a best practice to maintain written job descriptions for
            each job. Among other things, job descriptions are beneficial when hiring, processing
            accommodation requests, and making other employment decisions. Generally, job
            descriptions should include the essential functions of the job, necessary
            qualifications, and skills. If the physical demands and/or work environment are
            essential to the job, they should be included in the job description as well. If you
            include physical demands, focus on the task that needs to be done, rather than how it
            should be done. For example, say that the position requires <span class="q">“moving”</span> 50 pounds,
            instead of <span class="q">“lifting”</span> 50 pounds, or <span class="q">“traversing”</span> the length of the warehouse
            instead of <span class="q">“walking”</span> the length of the warehouse. Employees with disabilities may
            be able to perform the essential functions of the job with accommodation, such as using
            a cart, dolly, or mobility aid. Review job descriptions regularly to ensure that they
            accurately reflect the current requirements of the job.</p>
