      <p class="p">The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) requires certain employers with 11 or more
         employees to record work-related injuries and illnesses that result in death, loss of
         consciousness, medical treatment beyond first aid, days away from work, restricted work
         activity, or job transfer. Covered employers must record these incidents using <a class="xref" href="https://www.hr411.com/newsletter_landing.php?page=library.php-hritem_25424" target="_blank">Forms 301, 300, and 300-A</a>.</p>

      <p class="p">Exemptions: Employers in certain low-hazard industries, including retail, service, finance,
         insurance, or real estate are exempt from the OSH Act's injury and illness reporting
         requirements.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xcw1672727994339__section_N1004E_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">OSHA Form 301: Injury and Illness Incident Report</h2><p class="p"> Within seven calendar days of receiving information that a recordable work-related injury or illness has occurred, employers are required to complete Form 301. Form 301 requests information about the incident, including what the employee was doing at the time of the incident, how the injury occurred, and what type of treatment the employee received.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="xcw1672727994339__section_N10058_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">OSHA Form 300: Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses</h2><p class="p">Use OSHA Form 300 to record all instances of work-related injuries and illnesses for the calendar year. This report requests: employee name, job title, date of injury, where the event occurred, a description of the injury or illness, and the number of days the worker was away from work.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xcw1672727994339__section_N10062_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">OSHA Form 300A: Summary of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses</h2><p class="p">At the end of each year, covered employers must prepare Form 300A. This report summarizes the year's work-related injuries and illnesses with the total number of incidents by type. Each year between February 1 and April 30 employers must post the summary report in a conspicuous area of the workplace, even if no injuries and illnesses were reported.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xcw1672727994339__section_N1006C_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Privacy Concern Cases:</h2><p class="p">Employers must consider the following types of injuries or illnesses to be privacy concern cases: an injury or illness resulting from a sexual assault, a mental illness, a case of HIV infection, hepatitis, tuberculosis, a needlestick injury or cut from a sharp object that is contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious material, and other illnesses, if the employee independently and voluntarily requests that his or her name not be entered on the log.</p>
<p class="p">Instead of entering the employee's name on the space normally used for their name, employers are to enter the words <span class="q">“privacy case”</span>. Employers must retain a separate, confidential list of which case number is associated with which employee.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="xcw1672727994339__section_N1007D_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Retention Period:</h2><p class="p">These OSHA logs must be maintained for a period of five years following the year for which they relate. In addition, employers have an obligation to update the OSHA 300 log if the status of a case changes or new information is discovered at any point within the five year retention period.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xcw1672727994339__section_N10087_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">OSHA Required Medical Examinations:</h2><p class="p">Employers must also maintain records of any medical examinations required by OSHA. These records must be retained for 30 years following the employee's separation from the company. All medical records must be maintained in a separate secure file with access severely restricted.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="xcw1672727994339__section_N10091_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Hazardous Substance Reporting:</h2><p class="p">The OSH Act requires employers to maintain Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for each hazardous chemical within the workplace. The SDS is a document prepared by the chemical's manufacturer that describes the physical and chemical properties, health hazards, routes of exposures, precautions for safe handling, emergency and first-aid procedures, and protective measures. Employers are required to keep on file the most recent SDS for each hazardous substance and make it readily accessible to employees in their work areas. If exposure to toxic or hazardous agents occurs, employers are to keep records related to the incident for a period of 30 years.</p>

Check your state requirements to ensure compliance.</p>
