      <p class="p">Sexual harassment claims come in two forms:</p>

      <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Quid Pro Quo: </span>This is the demand for sexual
         favors in exchange for some job benefit (literally translated from Latin as <span class="q">“this for that”</span>). This form of sexual harassment is sometimes thought
         of in terms of <span class="q">“something for something.”</span> An example is a supervisor's
         demand that an employee have sexual relations with them to receive a promotion. The US
         Supreme Court says a quid pro quo sexual situation is harassment even if the harasser
         doesn't follow through with the promise of the threat or benefit.</p>

      <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Hostile Environment:</span> This is when harassing
         conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work, or creates a hostile,
         intimidating, or offensive work environment. This type of harassment may include offensive
         language, jokes, gestures, or comments, as well as offensive pictures, calendars or
         graffiti. Keep in mind that a hostile work environment determination is based on how the
         possible victim perceives the behavior, not on stereotyped notions of acceptable behavior. </p>

      <p class="p">Unlawful <span class="q">“hostile work environment”</span> generally involves a pattern of offensive conduct.
         However, the more severe the harassment, the less need to show that there is a series of
         offensive incidents. In fact, a single, unusually severe incident of harassment may be
         sufficient to constitute a Title VII violation. For example, the Equal Employment
         Opportunity Commission presumes that the unwelcome, intentional touching of an individual's
         intimate body areas is sufficiently offensive to alter the condition of the working
         environment and constitute a violation of Title VII.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wgo1672727980184__section_N1005B_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Same-Sex Sexual Harassment:</h2><p class="p">In 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex sexual harassment is prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The court said that critical issue for same-sex harassment (as well as opposite-sex harassment) is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed. In recent years, the number of harassment complaints filed by men has risen, with most of the complaints alleging harassment by other men.</p>

In addition, many states and local jurisdictions have enacted laws that expressly prohibit employers from discriminating against or harassing applicants and employees on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity and may cover smaller employers.</p>
