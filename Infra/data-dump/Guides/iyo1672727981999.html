      <p class="p">Despite your best efforts to maintain a positive, productive work environment, issues do
         occur. When they do, handle the situation promptly, fairly, and consistently.</p>

      <section class="section" id="iyo1672727981999__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Assess the whole picture.</h2><p class="p">Before you take disciplinary action against an employee, make sure you have a full understanding of the issue and that you have an accurate and impartial assessment of the employee's performance or conduct. Review the employee's goals and reflect on previous performance discussions. If the issue is related to alleged wrongdoing in the workplace, conduct a prompt, thorough, and impartial investigation into the allegations.</p>

      <section class="section" id="iyo1672727981999__section_N1004D_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Comply with nondiscrimination laws.</h2><p class="p">Avoid judging the employee's performance based on any protected factors and avoid taking adverse action against employees for protected on-duty and off-duty activities. For example, various federal, state, and local laws provide job-protected leave to employees. If an employee takes leave under one of these laws, adjust performance expectations to account for the leave. For instance, if an employee is expected to make 100 sales within six months, but takes three months of job-protected leave, their sales target should be reduced to 50.</p>
<p class="p">Various laws also protect employees from engaging in certain activities. For example, under the federal National Labor Relations Act, employees have the right to act together, with or without a union, to improve wages and working conditions, and to discuss wages, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment. If employees discuss improving their wages or whether to join a union, in or out of the workplace, the employer may not take adverse action against them.</p>
<div class="note note" id="iyo1672727981999__note_N10059_N1004D_N1003C_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>There are a number of other laws that protect employees for engaging in other types of conduct. Check your applicable laws to ensure compliance.</p>

      <section class="section" id="iyo1672727981999__section_N10060_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Determine the form of discipline.</h2><p class="p">If you determine the employee violated your performance or conduct standards and disciplinary action is appropriate, decide what form of discipline to take. Consider the severity of offense, the employee's past performance and conduct, and how you have treated other employees in similar situations (to ensure consistency). Employee discipline can take many forms, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Counseling and training. Typically the first step in the disciplinary process, counseling generally involves a conversation between the supervisor and employee. Make sure you document counseling discussions, including the date and substance of the conversation. Training may be appropriate when the employee is failing to meet job expectations because of a missing or underdeveloped skill.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Verbal warning. A verbal warning is generally tied to potential consequences if the behavior or performance issue continues. Document verbal warnings and store the documentation in the employee's personnel file.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Written warning. A written warning involves more formal documentation of the conduct or performance problem, including the steps the employee agrees to follow in order to correct the problem, the timeframe with which the employee is expected to improve, and consequences for failing to do so. A written warning should state that failure to show immediate and sustained improvement will result in further disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Have the employee sign the written warning and retain it in their personnel file.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Suspension and termination. These are the two most serious forms of discipline and are generally limited to serious performance or conduct issues or repeated failure to improve performance. Given the impact and risks of suspensions and terminations, consider requiring that these decisions be reviewed by upper management, human resources, and/or legal counsel. </span></li>
