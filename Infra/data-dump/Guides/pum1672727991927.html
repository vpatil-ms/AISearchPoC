      <p class="p">The following is an overview of some of the ACA's major insurance reforms. These provisions
         affect all employers who offer group health coverage, regardless of employer size. Keep
         these requirements in mind when evaluating your plan and working with your insurer on plan
         design.</p>

      <section class="section" id="pum1672727991927__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Essential Health Benefits:</h2><p class="p">The ACA requires that certain non-grandfathered group health plans (see the Grandfathered Plans section for more information on grandfathered and non-grandfathered plans) offer a standard package of benefits referred to as <span class="q">“essential health benefits.”</span> At a minimum, these benefits must include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Ambulatory patient and emergency services; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Hospitalization; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Maternity and newborn care; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Mental health, behavioral health and substance use disorder services; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prescription drugs; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Laboratory services; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Pediatric services including oral and vision care.</span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pum1672727991927__section_N10078_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Preventive Care:</h2><p class="p"><span class="q">“Recommended”</span> preventive services and <span class="q">“routine”</span> immunizations must be covered without subjecting participants to cost-sharing measures, such as a co-pay, deductible, or co-insurance, when such services are delivered by an in-network provider. This requirement does not apply to grandfathered health plans.</p>
<p class="p">Preventive Services:</p>
<p class="p">Some of the preventive services that must be covered include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Blood pressure, diabetes, and cholesterol tests; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Certain cancer screenings, including mammograms and colonoscopies; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Health counseling on issues such as quitting smoking, losing weight, eating healthfully, treating depression, and reducing alcohol use; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Routine vaccinations against diseases such as measles, polio, or meningitis; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Flu and pneumonia shots; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Counseling, screening, and vaccines to ensure healthy pregnancies; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Regular well-baby and well-child visits, from birth to age 21</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">As new services are approved, health plans will generally be required to cover them with no cost-sharing for plan years beginning the following year. A full list of covered services is available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.</p>
<p class="p">Routine Immunizations:</p>
<p class="p">Health plans must also cover, without cost-sharing, routine vaccines that appear on the Immunization Schedules of the CDC. The CDC's Immunization Schedules can be found <a class="xref" href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="pum1672727991927__section_N100BE_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Primary Care Physicians:</h2><p class="p">The ACA requires enrollees to be able to choose any available participating primary care provider as their doctor and available participating pediatrician as their child's primary care doctor. Women must be permitted to see OB-GYNs without a referral.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pum1672727991927__section_N100C8_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Annual &amp; Lifetime Limit Prohibition:</h2><ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Lifetime Limits: Health plans are prohibited from imposing lifetime limits on the essential benefits an individual may receive.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Annual Limits: The law also phased out the use of annual limits on essential benefits.</span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pum1672727991927__section_N100DA_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Nondiscrimination Rules:</h2><p class="p">Group health plans are prohibited from offering more generous benefits to highly compensated employees, such as shorter waiting periods for eligibility or lower employee contributions. Additional guidance is expected from the Treasury Department and the IRS, as well as the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services on how nondiscrimination rules will be applied to group health plans.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pum1672727991927__section_N100E4_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Prohibiting Pre-Existing Condition Exclusions:</h2><p class="p">Group health plans are prohibited from limiting or denying benefits or denying coverage simply because an individual has a <span class="q">“pre-existing condition,”</span> that is, a medical condition that developed before the individual applied for coverage. The ban on pre-existing condition exclusions applies to both grandfathered and non-grandfathered group health plans.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pum1672727991927__section_N100F2_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Dependent Coverage until Age 26:</h2><p class="p">There is no requirement for employer-sponsored health plans to offer dependent coverage, but if they do, the ACA requires they permit children to stay on their parents' health plan until they reach the age of 26. The requirement applies to both grandfathered and non-grandfathered health plans.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pum1672727991927__section_N100FC_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Changes to Rules for FSA, HRAs, and HSAs:</h2><p class="p">Health flexible spending account (FSA) salary reductions are limited to $2,550 per year. The $2,550 limit applies only to salary reduction contributions under a health care FSA and does not limit the amount permitted for reimbursement under an FSA for dependent care assistance or adoption care assistance.</p>
<p class="p">Prescription Required:</p>
<p class="p">Expenses incurred for a medicine or drug may be paid or reimbursed by an employer-provided FSA or HRA only if: (1) the drug requires a prescription; (2) the drug is available without a prescription and the individual obtains a prescription; or (3) the drug is insulin. A similar rule applies to HSAs and Archer Medical Savings Accounts.</p>
<p class="p">Limits on Annual Cost Sharing:</p>
<p class="p">In 2015, the maximum out of pocket cost sharing amount (deductibles, copayments and other amounts, excluding premiums) for high deductible health plans (HDHP) is limited to $6,450 for individuals and $12,900 for families.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pum1672727991927__section_N10112_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Rescissions:</h2><p class="p">Plans are prohibited from having rescissions or retroactive cancellations or discontinuation of coverage except in cases of fraud or intentional misrepresentation.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pum1672727991927__section_N1011C_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Waiting periods:</h2><p class="p">Group health plans and insurance issuers are prohibited from applying a waiting period for individuals otherwise eligible to enroll that exceeds 90 days. The 90 days is comprised of all calendar days including weekends and holidays. Being <span class="q">“otherwise eligible to enroll”</span> under the terms of the plan means the individual has satisfied the plan's substantive eligibility terms.</p>
<p class="p">Orientation Periods:</p>
<p class="p">Plans are permitted to use an <span class="q">“orientation period”</span> in addition to the 90-day waiting period as long as:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The period is not more than one month; and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The maximum 90-day waiting period begins on the first day after the orientation period</span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pum1672727991927__section_N1013F_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Excise Tax or <span class="q">“Cadillac Tax”</span> on High-Cost Plans:</h2><p class="p">Beginning in 2020, if an employer offers a high-cost plan, an insurer, plan administrator or employer will be subject to an excise tax of 40% of the value of the health insurance benefits exceeding the threshold. If the total cost of a group health plan exceeds certain thresholds (the anticipated amount in 2020 is $10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family coverage), the plan is considered a <span class="q">“high-cost”</span> or a <span class="q">“Cadillac”</span> plan.</p>
<p class="p">The cost of a plan is determined by the total premiums paid by the employer and the employee as well as the contributions made by both parties to plans such as Flexible Spending Accounts, Health Reimbursement Accounts, Health Savings Accounts and Employee Assistance Plans. The cost of vision and dental plans will not be factored when determining an employer's plan cost for purposes of the Cadillac Tax.</p>
<p class="p">Employers should speak to their brokers and insurers well in advance of 2020 to discuss the cost of coverage and ways to help avoid this tax.</p>
