Charges can also be filed for sexual harassment, wage discrimination, and discrimination based on disability or pregnancy.</p>
<p class="p">The first step an employee normally takes when he or she feels there is a discrimination or harassment issue is to complain to their employer. If a business receives such a complaint, it has an obligation to investigate. It is in the company's best interests to fix the problem if it exists or to resolve the issue with the employee as soon as possible. If not, the worker might consider taking the next step: filing a charge with the EEOC. With the exception of complaints under the Equal Pay Act, employees must file a claim with the EEOC before pursuing a lawsuit in a court of law.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="gil1672727999189__section_N1004C_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Filing with the EEOC and State Agencies:</h2><p class="p">In general, an employee must file a discrimination complaint with EEOC within 180 days from the date of the alleged violation. Many states have their own agencies that enforce state discrimination laws. Or, in a number of states, the employee can also ask the EEOC to <span class="q">“cross-file”</span> the complaint with a state agency. The amount of days the employee has to file the charge with the EEOC depends on the state in which the business is located. In some states, this limit is 180 days after the alleged discrimination; in others, 300 days. For many individuals, the alleged act of discrimination may actually be their termination. For others, it is the date of demotion, suspension or other negative treatment.</p>
<p class="p">In 2009, President Barack Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which clarified that the 180-day federal statute of limitations for pay-discrimination claims resets every time an employee receives a paycheck reflecting a discriminatory decision or practice.</p>

      <section class="section" id="gil1672727999189__section_N1005D_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">EEOC Investigation:</h2><p class="p">After the EEOC receives a complaint, the employer is notified that the charge has been filed. From this point there are a number of ways a charge may be handled:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A charge may be assigned for priority investigation if the initial facts appear to support a violation of law. When the evidence is less strong, the charge may be assigned for follow up investigation to determine whether it is likely that a violation has occurred.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">EEOC can seek to settle a charge at any stage of the investigation if the charging party and the employer express an interest in doing so. If settlement efforts are unsuccessful, the investigation continues.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">In investigating a charge, EEOC may make written requests for information, interview people, review documents, and, as needed, visit the facility where the alleged discrimination occurred. When the investigation is complete, EEOC will discuss the evidence with the charging party or employer, as appropriate. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The charge may be selected for EEOC's mediation program if both the charging party and the employer express an interest in this option. Mediation is offered as an alternative to a lengthy investigation. Participation in the mediation program is confidential, voluntary, and requires consent from both charging party and employer. If mediation is unsuccessful, the charge is returned for investigation.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A charge may be dismissed at any point if, in the agency's best judgment, further investigation will not establish a violation of the law. A charge may be dismissed at the time it is filed, if an initial in-depth interview does not produce evidence to support the claim. When a charge is dismissed, a notice is issued in accordance with the law which gives the charging party 90 days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The <span class="q">“relief”</span> available for employment discrimination, whether caused by intentional acts or by practices that have a discriminatory effect, may include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">back pay, </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">hiring, </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">promotion, </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">reinstatement, </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">front pay, </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">reasonable accommodation, or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">other actions that will make an individual <span class="q">“whole”</span> (in the condition s/he would have been but for the discrimination).</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Remedies also may include payment of:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">attorneys' fees, </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">expert witness fees, and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">court costs.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Under most EEOC-enforced laws, compensatory and punitive damages also may be available where intentional discrimination is found.</p>
