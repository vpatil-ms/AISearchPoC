      <p class="p">The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which took effect November 2009,
         protects Americans against discrimination based on their genetic information when it comes
         to health insurance coverage and employment. The Act prohibits insurers from denying health
         insurance or setting rates based on genetic factors, and similarly, forbids employers from
         using such information when making employment decisions. GINA applies to employers with 15
         or more employees.</p>

      <section class="section" id="rmd1672727995532__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><span class="q">“Genetic information”</span> defined:</h2><p class="p"><span class="q">“Genetic information”</span> is defined as: (1) information about an
            individual's genetic tests; (2) information about the genetic tests of a family
            member;(3) the manifestation of disease or disorder in family members of the individual
            (family medical history); (4) requests for, and receipt of, genetic services by an
            individual or a family member; <span class="ph em">and</span> (5) genetic information
            about a fetus carried by an individual or family member, or about an embryo legally held
            by the individual or family member using assisted reproductive technology.</p>
<p class="p">GINA defines <span class="q">“genetic test”</span> as the analysis of human DNA, RNA, chromosomes, proteins, or metabolites that detects genotypes, mutations, or chromosomal changes. Examples of genetic tests, include but are not limited to, the following: tests to determine whether an individual carries the genetic variant evidencing a predisposition to cancer; carrier screening to determine the risk of conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and spinal muscular atrophy; evaluations used to determine the presence of genetic abnormalities in a fetus; paternity tests; and DNA testing that determines the presence of genetic markers associated with ancestry.</p>

      <section class="section" id="rmd1672727995532__section_N1005A_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Anti-discrimination provision:</h2><p class="p">Employers are prohibited from using genetic information when making employment decisions, even if the information was obtained in a lawful manner. The law also prevents employers from retaliating against employees who oppose employment practices that violate GINA or who participate in an investigation under the Act. Furthermore, while not explicitly included in the law, the EEOC considers harassment based on genetic information unlawful.</p>
<p class="p">GINA also has a health insurance component which makes it illegal for health insurers to raise premiums or deny coverage based on genetic information. Chiefly, this provision affects employers who self-insure.</p>
<p class="p">Apart from six narrow exceptions, employers are prohibited from requesting,
            requiring, or obtaining the genetic information of an applicant or employee, or a family
            member of an applicant or employee. These exceptions are: (1) where the information is
            acquired inadvertently (e.g., information that is volunteered by the employee/applicant,
            overheard, or otherwise received accidentally); (2) information acquired through a
            voluntary wellness program that provides genetic testing or counseling, so long as such
            information is not individually identifiable; (3) information provided to the employer
            in connection with the certification requirements for a family and medical leave
            request; (4) when the information comes from sources that are commercially and publicly
            available, such as newspapers, books, magazines, and electronic sources; (5) as part of
            genetic monitoring that is either required by law or provided on a voluntary basis; <span class="ph em">and</span> (6) by employers who conduct DNA testing for law
            enforcement purposes as a forensic lab, or for human remains identification. Employers
            should review the regulations closely before determining whether an exception
            applies.</p>

      <section class="section" id="rmd1672727995532__section_N1006A_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Wellness programs:</h2><p class="p">Under certain circumstances, employers may acquire genetic information through wellness programs without violating GINA. First, the employee or family member must give prior, voluntary, and written authorization. In addition, no genetic information may be provided to the employer unless it is in aggregate form, so that no specific individual may be identified. Access to individually identifiable genetic information is reserved for the individual (or family member who is receiving genetic services) and the healthcare professionals or genetic counselors providing such services. Furthermore, employers are permitted to offer a financial incentive for individuals to complete a health-risk assessment; however, the incentive may not be contingent upon whether the participant provides genetic information.</p>

      <section class="section" id="rmd1672727995532__section_N10074_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Medical certifications:</h2><p class="p">Employers should review their medical examination forms as well as other forms that request health-related information, such as workers' compensation forms and fitness for duty forms, to ensure that they warn the employee and/or healthcare provider that genetic information mustn't be provided. In GINA regulations, the EEOC included <a class="xref" href="../library.php?hritem=6948639" target="_blank">model language</a> for lawfully requesting medical information. Employers are urged to adopt this model language on all applicable forms.</p>
