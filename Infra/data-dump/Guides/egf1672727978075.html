      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Rules for Conducting Background Checks</h2><p class="p">The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and similar state laws, have specific rules for conducting background checks, including requiring that employers provide written notification to, and obtain authorization from, any individual subject to background checks performed by third parties (usually, a professional background screening company). Under the FCRA, these third parties are known as consumer reporting agencies or <span class="q">“CRAs.”</span> The FCRA also requires employers to follow certain steps when taking adverse action against an individual (e.g., failing to hire) based on the results of the report.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Before Obtaining a Background Check</h2><p class="p">Under the FCRA, before obtaining a background check report provided by a CRA (referred to as a <span class="q">“consumer report”</span>), you must:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Tell the applicant or employee that you might use information in their report for decisions related to their employment. This notice must be in writing and in a stand-alone format. The notice cannot be in an employment application. You can include some minor additional information in the notice, like a brief description of the nature of the reports, but only if it doesn't confuse or detract from the notice.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Get written permission from the applicant or employee. If you want the authorization to allow you to get reports throughout the individual's employment, make sure you say so clearly and conspicuously. </span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Before Taking Adverse Action</h2><p class="p">Under the FCRA, before taking adverse action based in whole, or in part, on a consumer report, an employer must provide the individual with:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A copy of their consumer report; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A Preliminary Notice of Adverse Action; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A copy of <span class="q">“A Summary of Your Rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.”</span> </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Adverse action is defined broadly and includes, but is not limited to, denying a job application, reassigning or terminating an employee, or denying a promotion.</p>
<div class="note note"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Some state and local laws require employers to provide additional information applicants and employees before taking adverse action, beyond what is required by the FCRA. It is important to understand what state and local laws apply to your candidate before considering taking adverse action.</p>
</div>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">After Deciding to Take Adverse Action:</h2><p class="p">If you decide to take adverse action, the federal FCRA requires you to provide a final notice to the individual that:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Identifies the action taken; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Lists the name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting agency (CRA) that supplied the report; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Includes a statement that the CRA did not make the decision to take adverse action and is unable to give specific reasons for it; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Notifies the individual of their right to dispute the accuracy or completeness of any information the agency furnished, and their right to an additional report from the CRA within 60 days of a request. </span></li>

         </ul>
<div class="note note"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employers that use <span class="q">“investigative consumer reports”</span> – reports based on personal interviews concerning a person's character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and lifestyle – have additional obligations under the FCRA.</p>
