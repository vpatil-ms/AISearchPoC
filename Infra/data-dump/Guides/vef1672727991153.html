Paid time off can also boost productivity and help reduce unscheduled absences by giving employees the ability to schedule their time off.</p>
<p class="p">Some employers bundle leave into a single paid-time-off (PTO) bank, rather than have separate allotments for sick, vacation, and other personal leave. With a PTO program, employees are typically able to use their accrued time off for any reason. This can make it easier to track time off.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Eligibility: Some employers offer paid time off to both full-time and part-time employees. However, if you offer PTO to full-time employees, you are generally under no obligation to offer it to part-time employees. Employers that offer PTO to part-time employees usually do so on a pro rata basis.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Accrual versus frontloading: Employers can allow employees to accrue PTO over the course of the year or frontload PTO (grant all leave at the beginning of the year). While frontloading might be easier to administer, the accrual method can reduce costs if the employee leaves the company during the year. For example, an employee who receives two weeks of frontloaded vacation on January 1 and then quits on January 2 may be entitled to a payout for the unused time. Accruals require the employee to earn the time each pay period.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Carryover and payout: Some states explicitly prohibit policies that force employees to forfeit accrued, unused vacation and other PTO (also known as use-it-or-lose-it policies). In these cases, employers must generally allow employees to carry over accrued but unused PTO from year to year, or pay employees for the unused time at the end of the year. In some cases, a reasonable cap on accruals may be permitted. Similarly, in these states, employers are required to pay out any accrued, unused PTO at the time of separation. In some other states, employers are allowed to have use-it-or-lose-it policies only if the company has a written policy communicating the rule to employees. Check your state law to ensure compliance. </span></li>

      <section class="section" id="vef1672727991153__section_N1005B_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Paid Sick Leave:</h2><p class="p">While no federal law requires employers to offer paid sick leave to employees, some states and a number of local jurisdictions have passed legislation requiring employers to do so. Among other things, these laws address employee eligibility, accrual, permitted reasons for taking leave, and notice requirements. Covered employers should review these laws carefully to make sure their sick leave programs are compliant. Employers should also note that these laws may apply to you if you have employees working in these jurisdictions—even if your business is located elsewhere. Check your state and local law to ensure compliance.</p>
