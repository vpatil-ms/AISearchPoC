Employers can take steps to prevent sexual harassment, like clearly communicating to employees that sexual harassment will not be tolerated. Employers should also provide sexual harassment training to all employees. There may be cases in which, despite your best efforts, sexual harassment occurs; establish an effective grievance process and take immediate and appropriate action when an employee reports an incident.</p>
<p class="p">The following are 10 guidelines to help prevent and respond to sexual harassment:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="tmv1672727982328__ul_h1j_sny_txb">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Clearly communicate harassment won't be tolerated.</span> A
               written policy that clearly states that sexual harassment won't be tolerated is
               essential. The policy should also communicate the company's anti-retaliation efforts
               against individuals filing complaints or participating in an investigation of alleged
               harassment. The policy should be acknowledged by all employees upon hire and
               distributed regularly to serve as a reminder of its importance.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Enforce policy consistently. </span>Consistent enforcement of
               anti-harassment and anti-retaliation rules is one way to assure employees that the
               company is serious about preventing harassment and encouraging employees to come
               forward with complaints. To this end, employers should take all complaints seriously
               and protocols should be established for responding to harassment and protecting
               against retaliation.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Post the EEO notice.</span> All employers are required to
               post a notice describing the federal laws prohibiting harassment and other forms of
               employment discrimination. The poster is titled Equal Employment Opportunity is the
               Law and is available in the State &amp; Federal Resources section of the website.
               Conspicuously posting this notice demonstrates compliance with posting requirements
               and also raises awareness pertaining to harassment and discrimination.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Provide effective training.</span> Both employees and
               supervisors should receive sexual harassment training. Employee training should cover
               the employer's policy, provide definitions and examples of sexual harassment, and
               identify procedures for reporting harassing behavior. Supervisor training should also
               address responsibilities pertaining to preventing and responding to harassment. Note:
               In some states, such as California, Connecticut, and Maine, supervisor sexual
               harassment training is required. Check your state law to ensure compliance with your
               requirements.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Establish a complaint process.</span> A process should be
               established by which employees can report violations of the company's harassment
               policy. Employees should be urged to report inappropriate conduct immediately and
               without fear of reprisal, whether they are the victims of harassment or are
               witnesses. There should be multiple avenues through which employees may file
               complaints (i.e., more than one official outside an employee's chain of
               command).</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Ask employees about working conditions.</span> Rather than
               waiting for employees to file a complaint, employers can actively seek information
               from their employees pertaining to working conditions. Supervisors should have
               regular discussions with their staff to uncover any concerns they may have. If
               information about alleged harassment is obtained during these conversations,
               employers have a duty to investigate and take appropriate corrective action.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Investigate complaints promptly and thoroughly.</span> Once
               you receive a complaint, investigate immediately. Those conducting investigations
               should be thorough, impartial, and specifically trained in effective investigation
               techniques. Interviews with the accuser, the alleged harasser, and witnesses are
               necessary for gathering evidence and determining appropriate corrective action.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Consider interim measures.</span> Pending the conclusion of
               an investigation, employers may choose to take interim measures to prevent any
               further harassment. Interim measures may include transferring the accused, making
               schedule changes to avoid contact between the accused and the accuser, or placing the
               accused on paid leave pending the conclusion of the investigation. Keep in mind that
               interim measures must not burden the complainant.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Take corrective action.</span> If it has been determined that
               harassment occurred, the employer should take immediate and appropriate corrective
               action. Disciplinary measures should be proportional to the severity of the offense
               and administered on a consistent basis. It is also advisable to follow-up after the
               investigation to make sure the remedy was effective. Failure to follow-up can result
               in liability if the misconduct continues.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Document.</span> Keep detailed training records as well as
               records of harassment complaints, investigations, and any corrective action taken.
               Not only do these records provide documentation of your harassment prevention
               efforts, but they may also be referred to when investigating future complaints and
               evaluating patterns of harassment.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The effects of sexual harassment are often felt beyond just the harasser and the victim. Sexual harassment has an effect on morale, self-esteem, productivity, and the reputation of your business. Educating your employees can help protect potential victims, and inform potential harassers of the types of behaviors that will not be tolerated. Prevention is the best way for companies to deal with sexual harassment.</p>

      <section class="section" id="tmv1672727982328__section_N100A4_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employer and Employee Responsibilities:</h2><p class="p">Preventing sexual harassment in the workplace is beneficial to both the employer and the employee. The key is to create a safe and friendly environment that will foster the growth and the development of each individual employee as well as the organization as a whole. As a result, both the employer and the employee have responsibilities in order to achieve this objective.</p>
<p class="p">Employees also have their own responsibilities in the prevention process. Some examples include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Act professionally </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Communicating unwelcome behavior </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Keeping offensive material out of the workplace </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Understand company policy </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Report inappropriate behavior</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Be proactive by communicating to your employees that a lack of knowledge or ignorance is not a defense.</p>
<p class="p"> Keep in mind that as an employer when there are instances of sexual harassment you have the responsibility to investigate the incident even if the alleged victim was not offended by the behavior. The reason why you must do this is that while the alleged victim may not have been bothered by the behavior or considered it serious, there may have been other employees who were subjected to, or will be subjected to the same behavior in the future from the same individual. Maintaining a professional atmosphere is important to protecting all employees as well as the integrity of the work environment as a whole. If an individual is a victim of sexual harassment but refuses to file a complaint you should contact an attorney. Often times alleged victims will be asked to sign a statement that he or she requested and is comfortable with the circumstances. </p>
