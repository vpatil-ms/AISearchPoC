      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Glossary of Terms</h2><p class="p">Here is a list of terms commonly used in the ACA:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Affordable: In 2019, employer coverage under the ACA is deemed affordable if the employee's cost for self-only coverage under the plan does not exceed 9.86 percent (9.76 percent in 2020) of his or her annual household income.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Applicable Large Employer (ALE): Generally an employer that, together with other employers in their controlled group, employed 50 or more full-time and full-time equivalent (FTE) employees in the prior calendar year.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Controlled Group: When two or more entities are treated as a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) of the Internal Revenue Code. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Cost Sharing: The share of costs covered by insurance that the employee pays out of pocket. The term generally includes deductibles, coinsurances, copays or similar charges but does not include premiums or the cost of non-covered services.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employer Mandate (also known as <span class="q">“shared responsibility”</span>): The requirement for employers with 50 or more full-time and full-time equivalent (FTE) employees to offer group health coverage or face the possibility of a penalty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Essential Benefits: Certain group health plans must provide a minimum level of coverage that includes, among other things, certain health services, emergency services, maternity and newborn care, and mental health and substance use disorder services.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): These employees work less than 30 hours per week and must be factored in when determining an employer's size. An employer's total number of FTEs is calculated by adding all the hours worked by part-time employees (those working less than 30 hours per week) in a month and dividing by 120.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Fully Insured Health Plan: Generally, a type of plan purchased by the employer from an insurance company where the insurance company assumes the health coverage risk. Most employers offer fully insured health plans.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Grandfathered Plan: A group health plan that was in existence on March 23, 2010. For a plan to be considered grandfathered, it must refrain from making <span class="q">“significant changes”</span>. Grandfathered plans are exempt from certain provisions of the ACA.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Health Insurance Marketplaces (also known as an <span class="q">“Exchange”</span> or Small Business Health Options Programs (<span class="q">“SHOPs”</span>)): Marketplaces where both individuals and small employers can obtain health coverage from various insurance carriers.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Individual Mandate: Requirement for individuals to maintain health coverage or pay a tax.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Medical Loss Ratio (MLR): Proportion of premium revenues spent on clinical services and quality improvement. The ACA sets minimum medical loss ratios for different group and individual markets and requires health insurance issuers to submit MLR data.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Minimum Value: A health plan meets the minimum value standard if it pays at least 60% of the total cost of medical services for a standard population.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Pre-Existing Condition: Certain physical or mental health conditions for which medical advice, diagnosis, care or treatment was either recommended or received prior to an individual's enrollment in health coverage.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion Period: Some insurers accept individuals with a pre-existing condition on a conditional basis. This is the time period during which a health plan will not pay for care relating to a pre-existing condition. Under an employer-sponsored plan, this cannot exceed 12 months for a regular enrollee or 18 months for a late enrollee.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Preventive Services: These services are routine in nature and often include screenings, check-ups, and other patient counseling to help prevent illness, disease, or other health problems. Group health plans must offer preventive services without cost sharing.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Rescission: Retroactively canceling a health insurance policy for an individual, sometimes done if an individual made a mistake or intentionally misrepresented their medical condition when purchasing coverage. Under the ACA, rescission is prohibited except in cases of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of material fact.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Self-Insured Health Plan: Generally, a type of plan where the employer assumes the risk of paying participants' claims out of its general assets or a trust.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Waiting Period: The time that must pass before coverage becomes effective for an employee or dependent who is otherwise eligible for coverage under a group health plan. Waiting periods may not exceed 90 days. </span></li>
