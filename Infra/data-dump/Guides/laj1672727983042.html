The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has its own test for purposes of determining whether a worker is covered under these laws.</p>
<p class="p">According to the EEOC, whether an employer-employee relationship exists depends on whether the
            employer controls the means and manner of the worker's performance. Evidence that a
            worker is an <span class="ph em">employee</span> includes, but is not limited to, the
            following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employer has the right to control when, where, and how the worker performs the job</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The work does not require a high level of skill or expertise</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employer furnishes the tools, materials, and equipment</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The work is performed on the employer's premises</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">There is a continuing relationship between the worker and the employer</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employer has the right to assign additional projects to the worker</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employer sets the hours of work and the duration of the job</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The worker is paid by the hour, week, or month rather than an agreed upon cost for performing a particular job</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The worker does not hire and pay assistants</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The work performed by the worker is part of the employer's regular business</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The worker is not engaged in his/her own distinct occupation or business</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employer provides the worker with benefits, such as health insurance and paid time off</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employer withholds federal, state, and Social Security taxes</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The worker and the employer believe that they are creating an employer-employee relationship</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Other aspects of the relationship may affect the determination of whether an employer-employee relationship exists. Further, not all or even a majority of the listed criteria must be met. Rather, the determination must be based on all of the circumstances surrounding the relationship.</p>
