      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Trainees: Interns, Graduate Assistants, and Apprentices</h2><p class="p">Under the FLSA, not all individuals who perform duties for an employer are considered <span class="q">“employees”</span> entitled to the minimum wage, overtime, and other FLSA protections. Interns, graduate assistants, and apprentices may be exempt from these requirements as long as they meet specific <span class="q">“trainee”</span> criteria.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Interns:</h2><p class="p">In January 2018, the Department of Labor (DOL) announced that it will now use a <span class="q">“primary beneficiary”</span> test to determine whether interns are entitled to minimum wage, overtime, and other protections of the FLSA. The primary beneficiary test replaced a six-part test the DOL had been using.</p>
<p class="p">The primary beneficiary test looks at whether the employer or the employee is the primary beneficiary of the relationship. If the employer is the primary beneficiary, then the individual is an employee and entitled to all FLSA protections. Under this test, no single factor is determinative and the unique circumstances of each case must be weighed and balanced, including but not limited to the extent to which:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The intern and the employer clearly understand that there is no expectation of compensation. Any promise of compensation, express or implied, suggests that the intern is an employee.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The internship provides training that would be similar to that which would be given in an educational environment, including the clinical and other hands-on training provided by educational institutions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The internship is tied to the intern's formal education program by integrated coursework or the receipt of academic credit.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The internship accommodates the intern's academic commitments by corresponding to the academic calendar.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The internship's duration is limited to the period in which the internship provides the intern with beneficial learning.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The intern's work complements, rather than displaces, the work of paid employees while providing significant educational benefits to the intern.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The intern and the employer understand that the internship is conducted without entitlement to a paid job at the conclusion of the internship.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Employers should conduct an analysis on each case and consult legal counsel if necessary to determine the primary beneficiary of the relationship before classifying an individual as an unpaid intern.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Volunteers:</h2><p class="p">Volunteers are individuals who donate their services, usually on a part-time basis, for public service, religious, or humanitarian objectives, without the expectation of pay. Volunteers are not considered employees of the charitable or non-profit organizations that receive their service.</p>
<p class="p">Under the FLSA, employees may not volunteer their services to for-profit private sector employers. While individuals are allowed to volunteer their services to public agencies and their community, public sector employers may not allow their employees to volunteer, without compensation, additional time to do the same work for which they are employed.</p>
