Employers generally don't pay taxes on payments to independent contractors, and aren't responsible for providing minimum wage, overtime, or benefits to independent contractors. However, a worker is presumed to be an employee unless he or she meets certain requirements under federal and state law. Very few arrangements will meet these tests, and misclassification, which has become an enforcement priority for federal and state agencies, can lead to substantial fines and penalties.</p>
<p class="p">There are various tests for determining whether an individual is an employee or independent contractor. The particular test used depends on the purpose. For example, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses certain tests for federal tax purposes, while different tests are used by the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In addition, several states use their own criteria for making an independent contractor determination. Carefully review each test and consult legal counsel before classifying any individual as an independent contractor.</p>
