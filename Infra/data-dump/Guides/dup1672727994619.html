      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Notification Requirements</h2><p class="p">The ACA imposes a number of notification requirements on employers and group health plans. Here is a summary of some of these requirements:</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Summary of Benefits &amp; Glossary of Terms:</h2><p class="p">Group health plans and health insurance issuers are required to provide an accurate summary of benefits and coverage (or <span class="q">“SBC”</span>) and a uniform glossary of medical and coverage terms (or <span class="q">“glossary”</span>) to all plan participants and their beneficiaries. These notices must be furnished during open enrollment, when individuals otherwise become eligible to enroll in coverage, and within seven business days of a request. Additionally, when a plan is modified the issuer has 60 days to issue an updated SBC.</p>
<p class="p">The SBC is designed to answer questions about deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses and the costs and limitations associated with various types of medical events. The government has issued model notices for plans to satisfy the SBC notice requirement.</p>
<p class="p">The glossary is a list of terms and definitions commonly used in health insurance coverage, such as <span class="q">“deductible”</span> and <span class="q">“co-payment.”</span></p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Health Insurance Marketplace:</h2><p class="p">All employers, regardless of whether they offer health insurance, are required to provide their employees with a Notice of Coverage Options. The notice is intended to inform employees of the availability of the Health Insurance Marketplace and the potential impact of purchasing insurance through the Marketplace. All employees must receive the notice regardless of their status as full-time or part-time or their eligibility for coverage under the employer's plan. New hires must receive the notice within 14 days of hire.</p>
<p class="p">The notice must include the following information:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A description of the services provided by the Marketplace and how to contact the Marketplace;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">That the employee may be eligible for a tax credit if the employee purchases a qualified health plan through the Marketplace (if the employer plan's share of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan is less than 60 percent); and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If the employee purchases a qualified health plan through the Marketplace, the employee may lose any employer contribution to the employer-sponsored plan</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">There are two model notices to assist employers with this notification requirement:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">One for employers who offer a health plan to some or all employees; and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">One for employers who do not offer a health plan</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The notice can be hand-delivered, sent via first-class mail, or provided electronically in a manner that meets the requirements of the DOL's electronic disclosure safe harbor rules (See 29 CFR 2520.104b-1). There can be no charge or costs to employees for furnishing the notice.</p>
