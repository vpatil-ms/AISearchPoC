      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Voluntarily vs. Involuntarily Terminated Employees</h2><p class="p">The reason for an employee's separation is a very important factor in determining their eligibility for unemployment benefits. Employees choosing to leave on their own free-will are not entitled to receive unemployment compensation. However, if the employee can demonstrate that he or she had <span class="q">“just cause”</span> to leave, than unemployment compensation will be granted. Further, if an employee is terminated due to gross misconduct or other flagrant and intentional violations of company policy, he or she is ineligible to receive benefits.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Involuntarily Terminated Employees:</h2><p class="p">When dealing with involuntarily terminated employees, be prepared to show proof of misconduct on the employee's part. An employee who is fired for inadequate performance or for poor judgment will usually collect benefits. However, an employee that intentionally or deliberately disregarded company standards of conduct may be denied benefits. Fighting, insubordination, stealing, committing illegal acts on company property, failing a drug test, etc., are often legitimate grounds for a misconduct-based disqualification depending on the state.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Voluntarily Terminated Employees:</h2><p class="p">On the other hand, employees who resign voluntarily and without good cause are usually disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation. However, the question of <span class="q">“good cause”</span> comes up frequently. <span class="q">“Good cause”</span> (or an equivalent term such as "just cause") is generally understood to mean a real, substantial, and compelling reason that would lead a reasonable person to quit under like circumstances. In most states, the employee must establish that he or she had good cause to leave the job and that the reason for leaving can be attributed, at least in part, to the employer's actions or lack of action (e.g., failure to correct sexual harassment in the workplace).</p>
<p class="p">An employers' best defense to an employee's claim that he or she had good cause and should be granted unemployment benefits is a signed resignation letter or statement from the employee setting forth the specific reason for the separation. The best time to do this is while the employee is still on the job, preferably as soon as you learn that the employee intends to resign. A detailed resignation statement pins the employee down to the reasons stated, and it gives the employer a basis for determining whether the claim should or should not be contested. Moreover, if the employee claims that he or she is leaving because of sexual harassment, retaliatory discipline, unsafe working conditions, or discrimination, the employer can launch an immediate investigation and contact legal counsel. A resignation may be found to be equivalent to a <span class="q">“constructive discharge”</span> if the conditions on the job are so unpleasant that the employee is forced to leave.</p>
<p class="p">In most cases, good cause for quitting must be related to the job and not purely personal to the employee. The most notable exception to this is voluntary termination by an employee due to a domestic violence situation at home. An increasing number of states are now including domestic violence in the list of good-cause reasons for voluntarily terminating employment. Although state laws vary, most provide at a minimum that an employee may be deemed to have left work with good cause, and thus eligible for benefits, if he or she left employment to protect himself or herself or his or her children from domestic violence abuse. Many states require the employee to provide documentation of the abuse or to have tried reasonable alternatives before quitting, such as a temporary restraining order. In addition, many states do not charge employer unemployment insurance accounts for compensation provided to victims of domestic abuse.</p>
