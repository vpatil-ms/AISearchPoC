      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">COBRA Notification Requirements</h2><p class="p">Under COBRA, group health plans must provide covered employees and qualified beneficiaries with specific notices explaining their COBRA rights.</p>
<p class="p">Here is an overview of the various COBRA notices as well as the circumstances under which each notice must be provided:</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Summary Plan Description &amp; COBRA General Notice:</h2><p class="p">COBRA continuation rights must be described in the plan's summary plan description (SPD). In addition, each covered employee and each covered spouse must be provided with a general notice describing COBRA rights. Group health plans must give each plan participant an SPD and COBRA General Notice within 90 days.</p>
<p class="p">The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has developed a model General Notice that single-employer group health plans may use to satisfy the COBRA General Notice requirement.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">COBRA Qualifying Event Notice:</h2><p class="p">Depending on the qualifying event, either the employer or the employee is required to notify the Plan Administrator. The employer must notify the plan (within 30 days) if the qualifying event is a termination or reduction of hours of employment, death, entitlement to Medicare, or bankruptcy of the employer. Employees must provide notice to the plan if the qualifying event is divorce, legal separation, or a child's loss of dependent status (employees must be given at least 60 days to provide this notice). Group health plans are required to have reasonable procedures, established in advance, for how the covered employee or one of the qualified beneficiaries (or their representatives) can provide notice of a qualifying event.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">COBRA Election Notice:</h2><p class="p">After receiving a notice of a qualifying event, the Plan Administrator must provide qualified beneficiaries with an election notice describing their rights to COBRA continuation coverage and how to make a COBRA election. The COBRA Election Notice must be provided to the qualified beneficiaries no later than 14 days after the Plan Administrator receives notice of a qualifying event.</p>
<p class="p">The Department of Labor (DOL) has developed a model Election Notice that group health plans may use to satisfy this requirement.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Notice of Unavailability of COBRA Continuation Coverage:</h2><p class="p">The Plan Administrator may deny COBRA continuation coverage, or an extension of COBRA continuation coverage, when the Plan Administrator determines an individual is not entitled to coverage. When such a decision is made, the Plan Administrator must give the individual a notice of unavailability of continuation coverage. The notice must be provided no later than 14 days after the receipt of the notice of a qualifying event. The notice must explain the reason why he or she is not entitled to COBRA continuation coverage or an extension.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Notice of Early Termination of COBRA Continuation Coverage:</h2><p class="p">COBRA continuation coverage must generally be made available for a maximum period (18, 29, or 36 months, depending upon the qualifying event). The Plan Administrator may terminate COBRA continuation coverage early, but only for certain specified reasons.</p>
<p class="p">When a Plan Administrator decides to terminate COBRA continuation coverage for a qualifying reason, and before the end of the maximum COBRA continuation coverage period, the Plan Administrator must give the qualified beneficiary a notice of early termination. The notice must be given as soon as practicable after the decision is made, and it must include specific information.</p>
