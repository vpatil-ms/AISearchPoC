States often regulate the safety and health committees through their workers' compensation laws. Though establishment of such committees is not a federal requirement, many businesses maintain them even in states that do not require them, to help improve their safety and health programs.</p>
<p class="p">Safety and health committee members develop or oversee development of safety and health programs, monitor and help implement program elements, and evaluate program progress. An employer electing to establish a safety and health committee should make sure that it consists of an equal number of employees and management representatives. Establishments with 20 employees or fewer should have at least two members on the committee. Larger organizations should have at least four. Furthermore, committee members should receive training in hazard recognition and incident investigation.</p>
<p class="p">Below is a list of recommendations for the committee:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Meet regularly, but not less than quarterly. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prepare and make available to employees written records of the safety and health issues discussed at the committee meetings. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Review results of the periodic, scheduled worksite inspections. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Review investigations of occupational accidents and causes of incidents resulting in occupational injury, occupational illness, or exposure to hazardous substances and, where appropriate, submit suggestions to management for the prevention of future incidents. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Review investigations of alleged hazardous conditions brought to the attention of any committee member. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Submit recommendations to assist in the evaluation of employee safety suggestions. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Verify abatement action taken by the employer to abate citations issued by OSHA. </span></li>

         </ul>
