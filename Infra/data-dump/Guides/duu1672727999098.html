      <p class="p">Tipped employees are those who customarily and regularly receive more than $30 a month in
         tips, such as waiters, waitresses, bellhops, and bartenders.</p>

      <section class="section" id="duu1672727999098__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Tip Credit Rules:</h2><p class="p">Employers may consider tips as part of a tipped employee's wages (known as a <span class="q">“tip credit”</span>), but the employer must pay at least $2.13 an hour in direct wages</p>
<p class="p">Employers that elect to use the tip credit must ensure that the employee receives at least the applicable minimum wage per hour (when direct wages and the tip credit allowance are combined). If an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages of at least $2.13 an hour do not equal or exceed the minimum hourly wage, the employer must make up the difference.</p>
<p class="p">Employers must provide the following information to tipped employees before using the tip credit:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The cash wage the employer is paying the tipped employee, which must be at least $2.13 per hour;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The additional amount claimed by the employer as a tip credit, which cannot exceed the difference between the minimum required cash wage ($2.13 per hour) and the current minimum wage;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">That the tip credit claimed by the employer cannot exceed the amount of tips actually received by the employee;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">That all tips received by the employee must be retained by the employee except for a valid tip pooling arrangement; and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">That the tip credit will not apply unless the employee has been informed of these tip credit provisions.</span></li>

<div class="note note" id="duu1672727999098__note_N1006D_N10043_N1003C_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Some states do not permit the use of a tip credit. Of the states that do permit tip credits, some require direct wages higher than the $2.13 per hour threshold that is permitted under federal law. Check your state law to ensure compliance.</p>

      <section class="section" id="duu1672727999098__section_N10074_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Tip Pooling:</h2><p class="p">Employees must retain all of their tips, except to the extent that they participate in a valid tip pooling arrangement. Tip pooling refers to collecting employee tips so that they may be redistributed among all tipped employees. This is typically done to ensure that all employees working for tips receive their fair share, since the company is not always able to specifically identify to whom each tip was directed.</p>
<p class="p">Tipped employees may not be required to share their tips with employees who do not customarily and regularly receive tips, such as dishwashers, cooks, and janitors. In addition, tipped employees cannot be required to contribute a greater percentage of their tips than is customary and reasonable.</p>

      <section class="section" id="duu1672727999098__section_N10087_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Credit Cards:</h2><p class="p">Where tips are charged on a credit card and the employer must pay the credit card company a percentage of each sale, the employer may pay the employee the tip, less that percentage. This charge on the tip may not reduce the employee's wage below the required minimum wage. The amount due the employee must be paid no later than the regular payday and may not be held while the employer is awaiting reimbursement from the credit card company.</p>
