      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Sick Leave Laws</h2><p class="p">A number of states and several local jurisdictions have passed sick leave laws. Generally, these laws permit employees to take leave to care for themselves or a family member. Additionally, these laws typically address whether the leave is paid or unpaid, the circumstances in which employees can take leave, how much time they can take per year, how the leave accrues, whether the time carries over from year to year, and job reinstatement.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Paid Time Off (PTO) Bundled vs. Separate Sick Leave:</h2><p class="p">Generally, employers subject to paid sick leave laws may choose to offer paid sick leave through a single PTO policy. A PTO policy bundles various types of leave, such as vacation, sick, and personal leave, into a single bank that employees can use for any purpose. This option can be especially attractive for employers operating in multiple jurisdictions with paid sick leave laws. Generally, this approach is permitted as long as the PTO policy allows employees to use the same, or more, leave for the same purposes and under the same conditions as the most generous sick leave law.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Accrual &amp; Frontloading:</h2><p class="p">Employers generally have the option of choosing whether to frontload paid sick leave (grant all leave at the beginning of the year) or have employees accrue their time each pay period. Many employers prefer the accrual method since employees may only use what they accrue (and carryover) rather than having all of their leave available to them at once. However, frontloading the time can be easier to administer. Also, depending on the law, if an employer frontloads paid sick leave they may not be subject to carryover requirements. Check applicable paid sick leave laws to ensure compliance.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Carryover &amp; Payout:</h2><p class="p">Many paid sick leave laws require that all, or a portion of, unused sick time be carried over into the following year. In some cases, a reasonable cap on accruals may be permitted. In such cases, employees have to <span class="q">“use”</span> some of their time in order to earn any additional time.</p>
<p class="p">Additionally, some states and jurisdictions explicitly prohibit policies that force employees to forfeit accrued, unused vacation time (also known as use-it-or-lose-it policies). In these cases, employers must generally allow employees to carry over accrued but unused vacation time/PTO from year to year, or pay employees for the unused time at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="p">If sick leave is bundled into one comprehensive PTO policy, consider the impact of paying out the time upon termination. Be aware that in some states employers are required to pay out all accrued, unused PTO at the time of separation. This could result in additional costs because most sick leave laws do not require pay for unused sick time when an employee leaves the company.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Medical Certification:</h2><p class="p">Sick leave laws generally permit employers to ask for documentation, such as a doctor's note, but most only permit employers to make this request after an employee has been absent for a certain number of days. Even in the absence of such a restriction, consider what, if any, documentation would be reasonable to require from employees and apply your policy consistently. The documentation must generally be limited to confirmation that the employee was ill, rather than detailed information on a medical condition. This information should only be shared with those that need to know and should be stored in a secure file, separate from the employee's personnel file.</p>
