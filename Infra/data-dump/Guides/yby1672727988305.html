      <section class="section" id="yby1672727988305__section_N1005A_N10050_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">ADA:</h2><p class="p">Workers who qualify for benefits under WC are not automatically protected by the Americans with
            Disabilities Act. WC laws are designed to provide necessary assistance to workers who
            suffer from various injuries; ADA's purpose is to protect the worker from discrimination
            if he or she has any impairment that <span class="q">“substantially limits a major life activity”</span>
            or that <span class="q">“have a record of”</span> or are <span class="q">“regarded as”</span> having such an impairment. So
            a worker, for instance, awarded WC benefits after breaking a leg that healed in a few
            months, would not be substantially limited in life activities since the injury had no
            long-term impact. How­ever, if the leg took significantly longer than usual to heal so
            the worker could not walk for a long time, or if it left a limp that substantially
            limited walking as compared to the average person, this could fall under ADA. Also, an
            employee seriously injured while working for a former employer who was unable to work
            for a year would have a record of a substantially limiting impairment. If an employer
            believes that an individual's prior injury prevents the employee from doing a job, then
            this individual would be regarded by the employer as having a disability.</p>

      <section class="section" id="yby1672727988305__section_N10070_N10050_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">FMLA:</h2><p class="p">In some states, time off from work due to a work-related injury or illness can be charged against an employee's determined-number-of-week leave allotment under the FMLA. Once such a leave is designated as a federal FMLA leave, the employer cannot compel employees to accept light-duty work; under the Act, they have a right to refuse such a request and to remain on FMLA leave. However, employers should notify their state's WC commission of any refusal to perform light duty work as that effectively stops the individual's right to WC benefits.</p>

      <section class="section" id="yby1672727988305__section_N1007A_N10050_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">PRIVACY (HIPAA):</h2><p class="p">The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act protects all employees' medical records and other individually identifiable personal health information (PHI). PHI includes all information on employee health conditions, treatments received, and payment for such treatments. HIPAA permits HR to process individual workers' compensation claims without going against any of these regulations; however, if employees are treated by a healthcare facility, providers may not disclose PHI directly to employers without a HIPAA-compliant authorization.</p>
