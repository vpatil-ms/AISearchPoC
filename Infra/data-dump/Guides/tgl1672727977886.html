It is essential that employers designate one department or individual to be responsible for the administration of WC claims; failure to respond timely to injuries, claims, and government notices may result in validation of unwarranted claims and major expenses to the employer. Typically, this is how a claim procedure works:</p>
<ol class="concept">
            <li><span class="li">If an employee is injured on the job, he or she must notify the employer and then file a claim for compensation with the state agency that administers the compensation act.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Once the employer learns of the compensable injury, the employer must file a report with the state agency as well. Employers or individuals responsible for handling matters of WC in a company must be aware of all time limits and deadlines.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employer or their insurance carrier must either begin paying benefits or deny the claim.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If the claim is denied, the government agency investigates, conducts a hearing if necessary, and then either denies or awards coverage to an employee. If necessary, further appeal may be made to the courts.</span></li>

         </ol>
<p class="p"> All states have specific regulations regarding insurance payments for medical treatment at the time of injury, follow-up treatments, time-off for treatments, and some may even include transportation to and from treatments. </p>
