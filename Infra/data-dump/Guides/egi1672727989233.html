      <section class="section" id="egi1672727989233__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Q: Do we have to give poor performers an opportunity to improve? If so, how much time should we give them?</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> It is a best practice to monitor employee
            performance closely, provide frequent feedback, and intervene promptly when a
            performance issue arises. Generally, you should give poor performers a reasonable
            opportunity to improve. Depending on the circumstances, employers typically put
            employees on a 30-, 60-, or 90-day performance improvement plan.</p>

      <section class="section" id="egi1672727989233__section_N1004D_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Q: During a meeting about performance, an employee revealed that they have a disability that is affecting their work. Do I have to take this into consideration when evaluating their performance?</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> The employee's performance should be evaluated
            the same way regardless of whether the employee has a disability. However, when an
            employer learns of the employee's disability (the employee may use other terms such as
               <span class="q">“medical condition”</span>), the employer should begin a discussion
            with the employee to determine whether the condition qualifies as a disability, to what
            extent it impacts the employee's performance, and if a reasonable accommodation could
            address the problem under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</p>

      <section class="section" id="egi1672727989233__section_N10061_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Q: During a disciplinary meeting, an employee informed me that a mental illness caused their misconduct. Can the employee still be disciplined?</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> If an employee violates a conduct rule that is
            job-related and consistent with business necessity, and all employees are held to the
            same standard, an employer may discipline the employee for their misconduct under the
            ADA. Examples of workplace rules that are generally considered job-related and
            consistent with business necessity include, but are not limited to, rules prohibiting
            violence, threats of violence, stealing, or destruction of property. Consider consulting
            legal counsel if you have specific questions regarding disciplinary action for
            misconduct by an employee with a mental or physical disability.</p>

      <section class="section" id="egi1672727989233__section_N1006B_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Q What can I do if an employee refuses to sign a written warning?</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> Explain that the purpose of the signature is to
            confirm that the employee received the information, not that they necessarily agree with
            it. Give the employee an opportunity to provide a written statement if they disagree
            with the warning. If the employee still refuses to sign, note that on the written
            warning and then date it.</p>
