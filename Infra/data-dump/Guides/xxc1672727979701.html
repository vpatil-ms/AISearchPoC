See our <a class="xref" href="https://www.hr411.com/kits/kit.php?id=28" target="_blank">FMLA Toolkit</a> for more information.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xxc1672727979701__section_N10050_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">State Mandated Family Medical Leave:</h2><p class="p">Several states have their own family and medical leave laws, some of which cover smaller employers and/or permit leave under additional circumstances. Employers who are not required to provide family and medical leave may decide to voluntarily provide employees with this type of leave. If you choose to voluntarily provide family and medical leave, have a written policy that addresses eligibility, leave entitlement, length of leave, notice requirements, benefits continuation, reinstatement, and related issues. Refer to the Family and Medical Leave policy in the Employee Handbook Wizard to help structure your policy.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xxc1672727979701__section_N1005A_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Paid Family Leave (PFL):</h2><p class="p">A few states have paid family leave programs that allow employees to take family leave and receive partial wage replacement. These programs are generally funded either solely through employee contributions (via payroll deductions) or through both employee and employer contributions.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xxc1672727979701__section_N10064_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Interplay with Other Leave Laws:</h2><p class="p">Generally, when an employee qualifies for more than one type of leave for a covered purpose, the
            leaves run concurrently. This prevents employees from stacking leaves (returning from
            one leave only to go out on another for the same issue). To run concurrently, the
            employee must be eligible for both types of leave and the reason for the leave must be
            covered by both laws. For example, if the employee suffers a work-related injury and is
            on workers' compensation leave, the employer may generally count this time against the
            employee's federal FMLA entitlement as long the employee is eligible for FMLA leave and
            the injury qualifies as a <span class="q">“serious health condition.”</span>Generally, where federal,
            state, and local laws conflict, the law that is more generous to the employee applies.
