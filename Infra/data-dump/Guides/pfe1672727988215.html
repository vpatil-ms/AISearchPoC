Women who are pregnant or affected by related conditions must be treated in the same manner as other applicants or employees with similar abilities or limitations. A business cannot refuse to hire a pregnant woman because of her pregnancy, a pregnancy-related condition, or the prejudices of coworkers, clients, or customers.</p>
<p class="p">A business may not use pregnancy-related conditions to determine an employee's ability to work. However, a company can require the employee to submit a doctor's statement about her inability to work before granting leave or paying sick benefits. If she is temporarily unable to perform her job due to pregnancy, the employer must treat her in the same fashion as any other temporarily disabled employee. For instance, if a business permits temporarily disabled personnel to alter responsibilities, perform different assignments, or take disability leave or leave without pay, then the same must be allowed for an employee who is temporarily disabled due to pregnancy. Employees with pregnancy-related disabilities must be treated the same as other individuals temporarily disabled for accrual and crediting of seniority, vacation calculation, pay increases, and temporary disability benefits.</p>
<p class="p">Pregnant women must be allowed to work as long as they are able to perform their jobs. If a woman misses work as a result of a pregnancy-related condition and recovers, her employer is not permitted to require her to remain on leave until she delivers. Also, an employer may not prohibit her from returning to work for a predetermined length of time after childbirth. Companies must hold open a job for a pregnancy-related absence the same length of time the positions are available for employees on sick or disability leave.</p>
<p class="p">The business' insurance must cover pregnancy-related expenses that are the same as those for other medical conditions. Pregnancy-related expenses must be reimbursed just as those for other medical conditions. The amounts payable by insurance can be limited only to the same extent as those for other conditions. There can be no additional, increased, or larger deductible. Employers must provide the same level of health benefits for spouses of male and female employees. Pregnancy-related benefits cannot be limited to married employees.</p>
<p class="p">Companies cannot retaliate against an individual for opposing employment practices that discriminate based on pregnancy or for filing a discrimination charge, testifying, or participating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under Title VII.</p>
