      <p class="p">An employee must inform their employer of their intent to take leave; however, the employee
         is not required to mention the FMLA in order to qualify for FMLA leave. The employee's
         obligation to provide advance notice varies depends on the circumstances.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ckp1672727986565__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">When Leave is Foreseeable:</h2><p class="p">If the need for leave is foreseeable, an employee must provide at least 30 days' advance notice. If 30 days' notice is not practical, notice must be given as soon as possible. When an employee becomes aware of a need for FMLA leave less than 30 days in advance, generally, the employee should provide notice either the same day, or the next business day.</p>
<p class="p">If an employee fails to provide the required 30-days' notice when there is no reasonable excuse for a delay, the employer is generally permitted to delay the start of the leave for at least 30 days from the date the employee provides notice. When the need for leave becomes foreseeable within 30 days of the start of leave and the employee fails to give notice as soon as practicable, the extent to which an employer may delay leave depends on the facts of the particular case.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ckp1672727986565__section_N10050_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">When Leave is Not Foreseeable:</h2><p class="p">When the need for leave is unforeseeable, employees are required to provide as much notice as is practical based on the facts and circumstances. Generally, it should be practical for an employee to provide notice consistent with the employer's regular call-in procedures.</p>
<p class="p">If an employee fails to notify the employer of the need for leave, once the need for such leave has become apparent, the absences may be deemed unexcused. However, if the employee later demonstrates that he or she had a legitimate reason for not contacting the employer (for example, a sudden and unexpected hospitalization due to accident or injury) the employer must rescind any adverse action taken against the employee.</p>
