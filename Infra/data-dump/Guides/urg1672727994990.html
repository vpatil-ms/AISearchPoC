      <p class="p">In general, the maximum amount charged to qualified beneficiaries for COBRA continuation
         coverage cannot exceed 102 percent of the cost for similarly situated individuals covered
         under the plan who have not incurred a qualifying event (without regard to whether the cost
         is paid by the employer or employee). The additional two percent is intended to cover
         administrative costs. In general, for disabled qualified beneficiaries receiving the
         11-month disability extension of COBRA continuation coverage, the premium for those
         additional months may be increased to 150 percent of the plan's total cost of coverage.</p>

      <section class="section" id="urg1672727994990__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Timely Payments:</h2><p class="p">Plans must allow at least 45 days from the date of election (the date the qualified beneficiary mails the election form if using first-class mail) for the qualified beneficiary to make their initial premium payment. If a qualified beneficiary fails to make payment within the 45-day window, the plan can terminate the qualified beneficiary's COBRA coverage rights. The plan should establish due dates for subsequent premium payments, providing at least a 30-day grace period for each payment.</p>
<p class="p">Plans are permitted to terminate COBRA continuation coverage if full payment is not received before the end of a grace period. If the amount of a payment made to the plan is incorrect, but is not significantly less than the amount due, the plan must notify the qualified beneficiary and grant a reasonable period (30 days is considered reasonable) to pay the difference. If the notice is not provided by the plan, the qualified beneficiary is deemed to have made the correct payment.</p>
<p class="p">The plan is not obligated to send monthly premium notices, but is required to provide a notice of early termination if COBRA continuation coverage is terminated early due to failure to make a timely payment.</p>
