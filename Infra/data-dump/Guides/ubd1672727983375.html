      <p class="p">Complying with OSHA standards requires employers to partake in a variety of activities,
         including the following:</p>

      <ul class="ul" id="ubd1672727983375__ul_nxn_5rv_cwb">
         <li><span class="li">Installing physical safeguards or engineering controls, such as guardrails or fire
            extinguishers</span></li>

         <li><span class="li">Meeting safety requirements for work practices through employee training, company
            policies, and job supervision</span></li>

         <li><span class="li">Monitoring for air contaminants</span></li>

         <li><span class="li">Providing employees with personal protective equipment</span></li>

         <li><span class="li">Conducting equipment tests and inspections</span></li>

         <li><span class="li">Accident, illness and injury recordkeeping and postings</span></li>

         <li><span class="li">Determining when hazard warnings are required</span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="p">For the health and wellbeing of employees and for the betterment of their business, every
         employer should strive to maintain a safe workplace. To this end, private employers must
         adhere to industry-specific requirements and guidelines known collectively as OSHA
         standards).</p>

      <p class="p">OSHA's standards can be grouped into four major categories: agriculture, construction,
         general industry, and maritime (which includes shipbuilding, marine terminals, and
         longshoring). To ensure compliance, employers must know the standards that are applicable
         to their own business and industry.</p>

      <p class="p">There are hundreds of standards included within OSHA's standard industrial classifications,
         which regulate safety of work areas and cover precautions.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ubd1672727983375__section_N10070_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">General industry standards:</h2><p class="p">Employers covered under the OSH Act are required to follow all general industry standards that apply to their organization. In situations in which industry standards and general standards address identical hazards, industry standards take precedence.</p>
<p class="p">OSHA safety regulations for general industry cover many specific activities, areas, and conditions. OSHA standards that apply to most general industry employers include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Hazard Communication </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Emergency Action Plans </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Fire Safety </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Exit Routes </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Walking/Working Surfaces </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Medical and First Aid</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Other common OSHA standards include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Personal Protective Equipment </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Machine Guarding </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Lockout/Tagout </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Electrical Hazards </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Noise </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Confined Spaces </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Forklifts </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Bloodborne Pathogens</span></li>

      <section class="section" id="ubd1672727983375__section_N100C4_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Determining Compliance:</h2><p class="p">In order for employers to determine if their workplace conforms to general safety standards imposed by OSHA, they should follow these four steps:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Identify which standards apply to your workplace. This can be done by ordering a copy of the standards, visiting OSHA's website, and/or contacting the nearest OSHA office for assistance. OSHA small business consultants will help employers identify standards applicable to their industries.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Thoroughly read and review the introduction for every standard that is potentially applicable to your workplace. Most employers need to pay particular attention to the following standards that govern general office worksites: walking and working surface standards; exit routes, emergency action plans and fire prevention plan standards; occupational health and environmental control standards; fire protection standards; and material handling and storage standards.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Implement the requirements that apply to your company's function or operation. Compliance may involve meeting equipment design specification requirements, training employees, and establishing required practices as well as prohibited practices. It may also involve generating records, certifying compliance, or documenting required practices.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Be aware that any occupational hazard not covered by an industry-specific standard may be covered by a general industry standard or by the general duty clause.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">If an employer needs financial help in complying with the OSHA standards, the OSH Act has been amended by the Small Business Act to authorize loans, either directly or in cooperation with banks or other lending institutions. These loans are intended to assist in <span class="q">“effecting additions to or alteration in the equipment, facilities, or methods of operation of such businesses”</span> to comply with OSHA standards, or those adopted by a state pursuant to an approved state plan.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ubd1672727983375__section_N100E8_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The General Duty Clause:</h2><p class="p">The General Duty Clause (29 USC 654) requires every company to provide all employees with a workplace free from recognized hazards that are causing, or are likely to cause, death or serious physical harm. This obligation is open-ended, because it is designed to protect employees in situations where there are no established standards.</p>
<p class="p">An employer can be found to be in violation of the general duty clause if it can be shown that all of the following occurred:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A hazard existed;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The hazard was likely to cause death or serious physical harm;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The company had knowledge of the hazard, or should have had knowledge because the hazard had been recognized by the company itself, the industry, or common sense;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The hazard was foreseeable; and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Workers were exposed to the hazard.</span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="ubd1672727983375__section_N1010C_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Inspections &amp; Violations:</h2><p class="p"> OSHA ensures compliance with applicable health and safety laws by performing periodic inspections. OSHA inspectors typically visit a worksite in response to an accident or a complaint. If an accident occurs and the employer is found to be in violation of applicable safety rules, the consequences can be serious: legal fees, medical expenses, and/or government fines. Because the costs of non-compliance can be staggering, employers should be proactive in understanding and enforcing applicable safety standards. </p>
