      <p class="p"> Some employers choose to obtain an individual's criminal history when making certain
         employment decisions. Under federal law, the use of criminal records must be job-related
         and based on business necessity.</p>

      <section class="section" id="huh1672727980606__section_N10043_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">EEOC Guidance:</h2><p class="p">Using criminal history information to make hiring decisions may inadvertently result in disproportionately screening out a protected class of individuals. For this reason, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has provided guidance for employers in this area.</p>
<p class="p">Background:</p>
<p class="p">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from discriminating against applicants and employees on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The EEOC has stated that there are two ways the use of criminal records could violate Title VII:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Disparate Treatment: Treating applicants or employees differently based on a protected characteristic, such as their race, color, or national origin. For example, an employer may not reject a minority applicant based on their criminal record but hire a similarly situated white applicant with a comparable criminal record.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Disparate Impact: When an employer's seemingly neutral policy or practice has the effect of disproportionately screening out a protected group. If a disparate impact exists, it violates Title VII unless the employer demonstrates that the use of criminal records is job-related and consistent with business necessity. </span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="huh1672727980606__section_atn_1k1_vxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Business Necessity:</h2>
         
         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Arrests:</span></p>

         <p class="p">According to the EEOC, since an arrest is not evidence of guilt, an
            exclusion based on arrest information is not job-related and consistent with business
            necessity (and therefore violates Title VII). However, an employer may make an
            employment decision based on evidence of conduct underlying an arrest if the conduct
            makes the individual unfit for the position in question. This would require an inquiry
            into the alleged conduct, such as allowing the person to explain the circumstances of
            the arrest and making a reasonable effort to determine the person's credibility.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="huh1672727980606__note_N10066_N10043_N1003C_N10001"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Many states and some local jurisdictions have specifically
               prohibited, restricted, or advised against the use of arrest records to make
               employment decisions.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Convictions:</span></p>

         <p class="p">To establish that an exclusion based on a criminal conviction is
            job-related and consistent with business necessity, the employer must show a link
            between the specific criminal conduct, and its dangers, and the risks inherent in the
            duties of a particular position. Avoid broad exclusions based on a criminal
            conviction.</p>

         <p class="p">The EEOC has identified two ways employers can consistently demonstrate
            that an exclusion based on a criminal conviction is job-related and consistent with
            business necessity:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="huh1672727980606__ul_acf_2k1_vxb">
            <li><span class="li">The employer validates the criminal conduct screen for the position
               in question per the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures standards (if
               data about criminal conduct as related to subsequent work performance is available
               and such validation is possible); or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employer: <ul class="ul" id="huh1672727980606__ul_bcf_2k1_vxb">
                  <li><span class="li">Develops a targeted screen considering at least the nature and
                     gravity of the offense, the time elapsed since the conviction or completion of
                     the sentence, and the nature of the job; and </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Conducts an <span class="q">“individualized assessment”</span>
                     for those excluded by the screen to determine whether the policy as applied is
                     job-related and consistent with business necessity. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Individualized Assessment:</span></p>

         <p class="p">According to the EEOC, an individualized assessment should consist
            of:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="huh1672727980606__ul_rc4_bk1_vxb">
            <li><span class="li">Notice to the individual that they have been screened out because of
               a criminal conviction; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An opportunity for the individual to demonstrate that the exclusion
               should not be applied due to their particular circumstances; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Consideration of whether the additional information provided by the
               individual warrants an exception to the exclusion and shows that the policy as
               applied isn't job-related and consistent with business necessity. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Consider a variety of factors to determine whether exclusion based on an
            individual's criminal record should be applied, including:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="huh1672727980606__ul_sc4_bk1_vxb">
            <li><span class="li">The facts or circumstances surrounding the offense or conduct; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The number of offenses for which the individual was convicted; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Older age at the time of conviction, or release from prison (the
               EEOC notes that recidivism rates tend to decline as an ex-offender's ages increases); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Evidence that the individual performed the same type of work,
               post-conviction, with no known incidents of criminal conduct; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The length and consistency of employment history before and after
               the offense or conduct; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Rehabilitation efforts (e.g., education/training); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employment or character references and any other information
               regarding fitness for the particular position; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Whether the individual is bonded under a federal, state, or local
               bonding program. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <div class="note note" id="huh1672727980606__note_N100CB_N10043_N1003C_N10001"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Many state and local jurisdictions have enacted laws that echo and
               amplify the individualized assessment requirements discussed above. Check your state
               and local laws to ensure compliance.</p>
