In 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that an employer is automatically liable for a supervisor's harassment if it results in a tangible employment action. A tangible employment action is a significant change in employment status. Examples include hiring, firing, promotion, demotion, undesirable reassignment, a decision causing a significant change in benefits, compensation decisions, and work assignments.</p>
<p class="p">The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that <span class="q">“constructive discharge”</span> can be a tangible employment action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The constructive discharge theory is used by employees who assert that they quit because the working environment had become so intolerable as a result of harassment.</p>
<p class="p">If harassment doesn't result in a tangible employment action, the employer may be able to avoid liability by establishing an <span class="q">“affirmative defense”</span> that includes two necessary elements: (a) the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior, and (b) the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. In cases of harassment by a co-worker or a third party over whom the employer had some control, an employer may be held liable if it knew or should have known about the harassment and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.</p>
