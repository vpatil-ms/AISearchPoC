      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Eligibility</h2><p class="p">Specific eligibility requirements for unemployment compensation vary by state. However, most states' eligibility criteria center on the amount of time worked, the amount of wages earned, and the reason the employee is no longer employed.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Time &amp; Wages:</h2><p class="p">For an employee to be eligible for unemployment compensation, he or she must meet the state requirements for wages earned or time worked within a specified period, referred to as a <span class="q">“base period”</span>. In most states, this is usually the first four out of the last five completed calendar quarters prior to the time the claim is filed.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reason for termination:</h2><p class="p">An additional condition for eligibility relates to the reason the employee is no longer employed. Employees eligible to receive unemployment compensation are those who are unemployed through no fault of their own (again, this is determined under State law). An employee terminated due to theft, for example, is not eligible to receive unemployment compensation. In addition, an employee that quits on their own free will also is not eligible for benefits. However, an employee that was laid off would be eligible for unemployment benefits, as long as he or she meets other state-specific eligibility requirements.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Filing Requirements:</h2><p class="p">For continued eligibility, unemployed individuals must file weekly or biweekly claims (after the week(s) has ended), and respond to questions concerning their continued eligibility. They must report any earnings from work they had during the week(s), along with any job offers or refusal of work during the week. These claims are usually filed by mail or telephone; the State will provide filing instructions.</p>
<p class="p">When directed, the individual must report to the local Unemployment Insurance Claims Office or One-Stop/Employment Service Office. Failure to report may result in denied benefits. All individuals must also continue to meet other required eligibility criteria as well.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><span class="q">“Able and available”</span> requirement:</h2><p class="p">Unemployed individuals must be able and available for work in order to receive benefits. State laws define <span class="q">“availability”</span> in different ways, and some states have special rules for students or those performing military reserve services.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Exceptions:</h2><p class="p">Under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), states are not required to provide unemployment compensation to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Self-employed individuals</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Students performing services at schools where they regularly attend classes and students engaged in work-study programs</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employees working for a close relative, unless they are over the age of 21 and working for a parent</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Insurance agents and solicitors who earn only commissions</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Interns and student nurses working in hospitals</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Newspaper carriers</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Railroad employees</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">No federal unemployment tax is collected on the wages of individuals in the occupational categories listed above.</p>
