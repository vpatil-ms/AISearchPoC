It is essential that supervisors and managers are trained to identify and react to overt and subtle forms of inappropriate behavior and both informal and formal complaints of harassment. Supervisors and managers should receive effective training on enforcing the employer's policies.</p>
<p class="p">Unlawful sexual harassment can occur in a variety of circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The victim, as well as the harasser, may be a woman or a man. The victim does not have to be of the opposite sex.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, an agent of the employer, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or a non-employee.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The victim does not have to be the person harassed but could be anyone affected by the offensive conduct.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Unlawful sexual harassment may occur without economic injury to or discharge of the victim.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Remember, an employee or supervisor may not always be aware that their behavior is making others uncomfortable. If supervisors witness inappropriate behavior by an employee, they should be assertive and inform them that their behavior is inappropriate and use the proper channels and procedures to report and discipline the individual.</p>
<p class="p">Employees should be encouraged to tell an individual that his or her behavior is unacceptable and unwelcome if that is the case. In some instances, this can immediately resolve a behavior.</p>
<p class="p">An example of this is a supervisor who likes to put a hand on someone's shoulder when leaning over to point something out. An employee should be able to politely tell the supervisor that this is unwelcome behavior without fear of retaliation. A supervisor may be unaware that they even have this behavioral tendency and should accept the feedback constructively.</p>
<p class="p">If that does not stop the harassment or there is a negative result from expressing the discomfort, the victim should then report the activity according to the company procedure.</p>
<p class="p">Below is a list of some additional tips for managers:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Remain professional.</span> Managers should make sure they do not
            tolerate, or engage in, inappropriate behavior. Tolerating cases of a hostile
            environment as, <span class="q">“just joking around”</span> or as <span class="q">“harmless teasing”</span> only further
            perpetuates the stereotypes that these behaviors are acceptable. Take a clear stance on
            sexual harassment, and let your employees know it.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Communicate what constitutes inappropriate behavior.</span> Explicitly
            inform all employees as to what types of behaviors are unacceptable.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Make sure all employees understand company policy.</span> Postings, staff
            training, and the development of complaint procedures. Have employees sign
            acknowledgment forms stating they understand, and agree to, the policy. Communicate the
            importance of your sexual harassment policy.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Be observant of workplace behavior.</span> If you recognize a situation as
            a hostile environment, immediately report the behavior to the appropriate personnel.
            Keep in mind, a business can be held liable for instances of sexual harassment if they
            fail to take action. </p>
