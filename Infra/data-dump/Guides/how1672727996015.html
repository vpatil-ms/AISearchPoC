<p class="p">Pay discrimination can occur in a number of ways. Some examples may include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">An employer pays employees of a certain protected class less than similarly situated employees outside the protected class, and the employer's explanation (if any) does not satisfactorily account for the differential;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employer maintains a neutral compensation policy or practice that has an adverse impact on employees in a protected class and cannot be justified as job-related and consistent with business necessity;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A discriminatory compensation system has been discontinued, but salary disparities
               caused by the system have not been eradicated; <span class="ph em">or</span></span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The compensation of one or more employees in a protected class is artificially depressed because of a discriminatory employer practice that affects compensation, such as steering employees in a protected class to lower paid jobs, or discriminating in promotions, performance appraisals, procedures for assigning work, or training opportunities.</span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="how1672727996015__section_N10067_N10040_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Equal Pay Act:</h2><p class="p">One federal law in particular specifically addresses equality in pay. The Equal Pay Act requires that men and women be given equal pay for equal work. The jobs need not be identical, but they must be substantially equal. It is job content, not the job title, that determines whether jobs are substantially equal.</p>
<p class="p">Specifically, the EPA provides that employers may not pay unequal wages to men and women who perform jobs that require substantially equal skill, effort and responsibility, and that are performed under similar working conditions. Each of these factors is summarized below:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Skill</span> is measured by factors such as the experience,
               ability, education, and training required to perform the job. The issue is what
               skills are required for the job, not what skills the individual employees may have.
               For example, two bookkeeping jobs could be considered equal under the EPA even if one
               of the job holders has a master's degree in physics, since that degree would not be
               required for the job.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Effort</span> is the amount of physical or mental exertion
               needed to perform the job. For example, suppose that men and women work side by side
               on a line assembling machine parts. The person at the end of the line must also lift
               the assembled product as he or she completes the work and place it on a board. That
               job requires more effort than the others if the extra effort of lifting the assembled
               product off the line is substantial and is a regular part of the job. As a result, it
               would likely not be a violation to pay that person more, regardless of whether the
               job is held by a man or a woman.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Responsibility</span> is the degree of accountability
               required in performing the job. For example, a salesperson who is delegated the duty
               of determining whether to accept customers' personal checks has more responsibility
               than other salespeople. On the other hand, a minor difference in responsibility, such
               as turning out the lights at the end of the day, would not justify a pay
               differential.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Working conditions</span> encompass two factors: (1) physical
               surroundings like temperature, fumes, and ventilation; and (2) hazards. Pay
               differentials for employees exposed to adverse working conditions may be considered
               appropriate.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Pay differentials may be permitted if they are based on seniority, merit, quantity or quality of production, or a factor other than sex. These are known as <span class="q">“affirmative defenses”</span> and it is the employer's burden to prove that they apply.</p>
<p class="p"> In correcting pay inequities, no employee's pay may be reduced. Instead, the pay of the lower paid employee(s) must be increased. </p>
