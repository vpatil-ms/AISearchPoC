It is best for each employer to research the laws that specifically govern those states in which the business is located.</p>
<p class="p">Some laws extend protection similar to that provided by the federal acts to employers who are not covered by those statutes. Other statutes provide protection to groups not covered by the federal acts. For example, though an employer with less than 15 employees is not covered by the ADA, they may still have to comply with a state-imposed regulation regarding discrimination based on disability (a state may prohibit discrimination and mandate reasonable accommodations for the disabled regardless of the number of employees).</p>
<p class="p">Other statutes provide protection to groups not covered by the federal acts. For instance, many states have passed statutes protecting all workers in the states from employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and several others states prohibit public sector employers from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. In addition, a number of state statutes provide protection for individuals who are performing civil or family duties outside of their normal employment.</p>
<p class="p">Some states provide additional protections not provided at the federal level. Included among these are the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Protections barring discrimination on the basis of marital status</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Welfare recipient status</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Wage garnishment for child support</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Record of an arrest and/or conviction</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Armed services or National Guard participation</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">All of these follow the general principles of other anti-discrimination laws that prohibit any differentiation in treatment, including harassment, stereotyping, derogatory epithets, or discrimination based on membership in associations.</p>
