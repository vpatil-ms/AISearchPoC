      <p class="p">Many employers contribute to some type of retirement plan for their employees. Aside from
         their utility as an element of compensation and as a means of forced savings, such plans
         are a good way of sheltering otherwise taxable income. For that reason, these plans are of
         particular value to highly compensated employees.</p>

      <p class="p">Common types of company-sponsored retirement plans:</p>

      <section class="section" id="rsq1672727988866__section_N10047_N1003C_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">401(k) Plans:</h2><p class="p">An employee's 401(k) contributions are automatically deducted from his or her paycheck each pay period. Traditional 401(k) plans allow employees to make contributions on a pre-tax basis. In a Roth 401(k) plan employee contributions are taxed, but eligible distributions from the account (including earnings) are generally tax-free. With both types of plans, contributions are invested at the employee's direction into one or more funds provided in the plan. Employers often <span class="q">“match”</span> employee contributions up to a certain percentage, but are not required to do so.</p>

Contributions are made to an Individual Retirement Account or Annuity (IRA) set up for each plan participant (a SEP-IRA). An SEP does not have the start-up and operating costs of a conventional retirement plan.</p>

In general, employers must have 100 or fewer employees and no other retirement plan to establish a SIMPLE IRA. Employees may choose to make salary reduction contributions and the employer is required to make either matching or non-elective contributions. Contributions are made to an Individual Retirement Account or Annuity (IRA) set up for each employee (a SIMPLE IRA).</p>
