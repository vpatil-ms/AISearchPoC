      <p class="p">The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued new guidance to help employers and employees identify risks of being exposed to and/or contracting COVID-19 at work.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">COVID-19 Prevention Programs:</h2><p class="p">In the guidance, OSHA makes clear that implementing a workplace COVID-19 prevention program is the most effective way to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 at work.</p>
<p class="p">The program should engage workers and their representatives in the program's development and implementation at every step, and include the following elements:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Assignment of a workplace coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 issues on the employer's behalf. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Identification of where and how workers might be exposed to COVID-19 at work. This includes a thorough assessment to identify potential workplace hazards related to COVID-19 and identifying measures that will limit the spread of COVID-19. Some examples include:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li"><a class="xref" href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/safework#eliminating-the-hazard" target="_blank">Eliminating the hazard by separating and sending home infected or potentially infected people</a>; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li"><a class="xref" href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/safework#implement-physical-distancing" target="_blank">Implementing physical distancing in all communal work areas</a>; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li"><a class="xref" href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/safework#installing-barriers" target="_blank">Installing barriers where physical distancing cannot be maintained</a>; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li"><a class="xref" href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/safework#use-ppe" target="_blank">Using face coverings and applicable personal protective equipment to protect workers from exposure</a>; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li"><a class="xref" href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/safework#provide-the-supplies" target="_blank">Providing necessary supplies for good hygiene practices</a>; and </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li"><a class="xref" href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/safework#perform-routine-cleaning-disinfection" target="_blank">Performing routine cleaning and disinfection</a>. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Consideration of protections for workers at <a class="xref" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html" target="_blank">higher risk for severe illness</a> through supportive policies and practices. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Establishment of a system for communicating effectively with workers and in a language they understand as well as education and training on COVID-19 policies and procedures. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Instruct workers who are infected or potentially infected to stay home and isolate or quarantine to prevent or reduce the risk of transmission. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Minimize the negative impact of quarantine and isolation on workers (such as, allowing employees to telework and providing paid sick leave). </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Isolating workers who show symptoms at work. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Performing enhanced cleaning and disinfection after people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 have been in the facility. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Closing areas used by the potentially infected person for enhanced cleaning. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Providing guidance on screening and testing. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Implementing protections from retaliation and setting up an anonymous process for workers to voice concerns about COVID-19-related hazards. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Making a COVID-19 vaccine available at no cost to all eligible employees and providing information and training on the benefits and safety of vaccinations. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Other applicable OSHA Standards (all of OSHA's standards that apply to protecting workers from infection remain in place). </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Details on each of these elements as well as other measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 can be found in the <a class="xref" href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/safework" target="_blank">guidance</a>.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">While the guidance creates no new legal obligations and doesn't carry the same weight as a law or regulation, employers may find it helpful in identifying the risks of exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace and in determining appropriate control measures to implement. OSHA says it expects to continue to update the guidance over time to reflect developments in science, best practices, and standards.</p>
<p class="p">Keep in mind that some states and local jurisdictions have established their own requirements for employers to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace, many of which are covered in our <a class="xref" href="https://sbshrs.adpinfo.com/covid19-state-emergency-leave-laws" target="_blank">COVID-19 Resource Center</a>.</p>
