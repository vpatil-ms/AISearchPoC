                           declaration requirement takes effect on January 1, 2024.</p>

            636. Because we do not know if the Labor Commissioner will publish sample notices or

            employers may want to discuss how to address the requirement with legal counsel.</p>

               with the state's expanded paid sick leave requirements, which take effect January 1,
