            <p class="p">Governor Kathy Hochul has signed legislation (Senate Bill 4934A) that expands
                  protections for whistleblowers. Senate Bill 4934A takes effect on January 26,
                  2022.</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Background:</span></p>

            <p class="p">New York Labor Law Section 740 prohibits employers from retaliating
                  against employees who disclose, or threaten to disclose, an <span class="ph em">actual</span> violation of a law that poses a substantial and specific danger
                  to the public's health or safety.</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Senate Bill 4934A:</span></p>

            <p class="p">The amendment extends whistleblower protections in numerous ways:</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Expanded worker coverage:</span></p>

            <p class="p">Senate Bill 4934A extends Section 740's whistleblower protections to include not only
                  current employees, but also former employees and independent contractors.</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Protected activity expanded:</span></p>

            <p class="p">The new law expands the scope of activity protected so that an
                  employee can now report not only actual violations impacting public health and
                  safety, but also <span class="ph em">any</span> activity, practice or policy that
                  the employee <span class="ph em">reasonably believes</span> violates any law,
                  order, ruling or decision, regardless of the subject matter. Employees are also
                  now protected whether or not they were acting within the scope of their job
                  duties.</p>

            <p class="p">In addition, under certain circumstances, employees may report alleged violations
                  directly to a public body bypassing their employer when the employee reasonably
                  believes that a supervisor is aware and won't correct the alleged violation or
                  would conceal or destroy evidence.</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Expanded prohibited retaliatory
                  action:</span></p>

            <p class="p">Senate Bill 4934A expands prohibited retaliatory action to include adversely
                  impacting a former employee's current or future employment, including contacting
                  immigration authorities or reporting the immigration status of employees or their
                  family members. Previously, retaliatory action was limited to discharge,
                  suspension, demotion or adversely impacting terms and conditions of
                  employment.</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Extended time to bring a claim:</span></p>

            <p class="p">The new law extends the statute of limitations for filing a claim from one to two
                  years.</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Notice Requirements:</span></p>

            <p class="p">Employers must post a notice of the protections, rights, and obligations of employees
                  in a conspicuous, easily accessible, and well-lit place customarily visited by
                  employees and job applicants.</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Additional Penalties:</span></p>

            <p class="p">The amendment provides for additional penalties against employers found to have
                  violated the law.</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Compliance Recommendations:</span></p>

            <p class="p">New York employers should post the required notice and review their policies and
                  practices to ensure compliance with Senate Bill 4934A. Employers should also train
                  supervisors on how to respond to reports of potential violations.</p>
