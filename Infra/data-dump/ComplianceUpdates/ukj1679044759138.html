      <p class="p">The U.S. Department of Education (ED) has announced an extension of the federal student relief that has been in place since March of 2020. During the extension, repayments, interest, and collection of federal student loans continue to be suspended. This latest extension is to allow time for the U.S. Supreme Court to hear legal challenges to the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness program.</p>

      <p class="p">Loan repayments will resume 60 days after the ED is allowed to implement Biden's program or the U.S. Supreme Court decides the case. If the program has not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June 30, 2023, repayments will resume 60 days thereafter.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ukj1679044759138__section_m51_gll_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">On August 24, 2022, President Biden announced a program that allows for a certain amount
            of student loan debt forgiveness for individuals earning less than $125,000 ($250,000 if
            married filing jointly) in either the 2020 or 2021 tax year. Under the program,
            borrowers earning less than amounts noted above who received a Pell Grant would be
            eligible for up to $20,000 in debt cancellation. Borrowers meeting the income limits but
            not receiving a Pell Grant would be eligible for up to $10,000 in relief.</p>

         <p class="p">Subsequent to the loan forgiveness program announcement, a number of parties filed suit
            to stop the program from taking effect. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments
            in February of 2023 to determine whether the program can be implemented. A decision is
            expected around June of 2023.</p>

         <p class="p">ADP will continue to monitor the legal challenges to the program and will report once
            the Supreme Court has handed down its decision.</p>
