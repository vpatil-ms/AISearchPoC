      <p class="p">California's Civil Rights Division (CRD) has released <a class="xref" href="https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/paydatareporting/" target="_blank">updated frequently asked questions, templates, and a user
            guide</a> for the 2023 pay data reporting period for employers with 100 or more
         employees. Employers must use the <a class="xref" href="https://pdr.calcivilrights.ca.gov/s/" target="_blank">CRD's online pay data reporting portal</a> to submit their annual reports. The
         portal is open. The reporting deadline for 2023 is May 8, 2024.</p>

      <section class="section" id="uvr1707895739974__section_N10050_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         <p class="p subHeading1">Background</p>
<p class="p">A private employer that has 100 or more employees, with at least one California employee, must submit a pay data report covering the prior calendar year to the state on or before the second Wednesday of May each year, regardless of whether they are required to submit an EEO-1 report.</p>
<p class="p">A private employer that has 100 or more employees, with at least one California employee, hired through labor contractors within the prior calendar year must also submit a separate pay data report to the state covering those employees. The private employer must also disclose on the pay data report the ownership names of all labor contractors used to supply employees. A labor contractor must supply all necessary pay data to the private employer.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Updated Guidance and Tools</p>

         <p class="p">The CRD has updated its answers to frequently asked questions for the 2023 reporting
            period. Here are a few key updates:</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Updated Data Fields for Reporting Remote Workers</p>

         <p class="p">Employers must now report the number of employees in an employee group who work remotely
            during the Snapshot Period. The CRD defines a remote worker as a payroll or labor
            contractor employee who is entirely remote, teleworking, or home-based, and has no
            expectation to regularly report in person to a physical establishment to perform work
            duties.</p>

         <p class="p">The templates now have fields for: (1) the number of employees that don't work remotely,
            (2) the number of remote employees located within California, and (3) the number of
            remote employees located outside of California.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="uvr1707895739974__note_an2_pxp_m1c"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employees in hybrid roles or (partial) teleworking arrangements expected to appear in
               person to perform work at a particular establishment for any portion of time during
               the Snapshot Period would not be considered remote workers for pay data reporting
               purposes.</p>

            <p class="p">Labor Contractor Demographic Data</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p">The updated guidance also makes clear that for Labor Contractor Employee Reports,
            reporting <span class="q">“unknown”</span> race/ethnicity or sex of a labor contractor employee is no
            longer permitted.</p>

         <p class="p">Employee self-identification is the preferred method of identifying race/ethnicity
            information, according to the CRD. If an employee declines to state their
            race/ethnicity, employers must still report the employee according to one of the seven
            race/ethnicity categories, using (in the following order): current employment records,
            other reliable records or information, or observer perception.</p>

         <p class="p">The CRD says it recognizes the risk of inaccurate race/ethnicity identification based on
            observer perception alone; this method should only be used after making a good faith
            effort to obtain race/ethnicity information from the employee or from other reliable
            records. When an employer uses observer perception, the CRD encourages employers to
            utilize the clarifying remarks field to state they have done so, stating for example:
               <span class="q">“The race/ethnicity of [number] employees in this employee grouping is being
               reported based on observer perception.”</span></p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Updated Templates</p>

         <p class="p">The CRD has also updated templates for the 2023 reporting period. Employers shouldn't
            use Excel templates or .CSV examples from prior years; the portal will reject
            submissions based on outdated versions of the templates.</p>
