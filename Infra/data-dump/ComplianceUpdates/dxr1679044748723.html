      <p class="p">The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) has revised emergency rules for protecting workers from COVID-19. The emergency rules became effective on May 6, 2022 and will remain in effect through December 31, 2022.</p>

      <section class="section" id="dxr1679044748723__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2><p class="p">By way of background, Cal/OSHA first adopted COVID-19 prevention emergency temporary standards (ETS) in late 2020. Under the Cal/OSHA ETS, most employers must establish, implement, and maintain an effective, written COVID-19 Prevention Program that contains specified elements. Cal/OSHA has now revised the ETS three times.</p>
<p class="p">Here's are some of the key changes in the third revision:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Face Coverings:</span> Face coverings are no
               longer required for unvaccinated employees in all indoor locations. Under the amended
               ETS, however, face coverings are mandatory when California Department of Public
               Health Guidance (CPDH) requires their use. Employers must now review and monitor CPDH
                  <a class="xref" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx" target="_blank">Guidance for the Use of Face Masks</a> to learn
               when face coverings are required.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Note: Employees are still entitled to request face coverings from their employer at no cost to the employee and can wear them at work, regardless of vaccination status. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Respirators:</span> Employers must provide
               respirators to employees who request them and work indoors for voluntary use
               regardless of vaccination status. Previously, this requirement only applied to
               unvaccinated employees. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Cleaning and Disinfecting:</span> The
               cleaning and disinfecting requirements have been deleted. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Testing:</span> Employers are now required to
               make COVID-19 testing available at no cost and during paid time to employees with
               COVID-19 symptoms regardless of vaccination status and regardless of whether there is
               a known exposure. Previously, this applied to unvaccinated employees only. The
               definition of an acceptable COVID-19 test was also changed with respect to
               self-administered and self-read tests. A video or observation of the entire test
               process is no longer necessary for such tests--just a date/timestamped photo of the
               test result will now be sufficient. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Exclusion:</span> The detailed prescriptive
               requirements for exclusion of employees after close contact have been deleted.
               Instead, employers must review <a class="xref" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-on-Isolation-and-Quarantine-for-COVID-19-Contact-Tracing.aspx" target="_blank">CPDH guidelines</a> for individuals who had
               close contact and implement quarantine and other measures in the workplace to prevent
               COVID-19 transmission in the workplace. The requirements for employees who test
               positive for COVID-19 have been updated to reflect the most recent CDPH isolation and
               quarantine guidelines. Regardless of vaccination status, positive employees can
               return to work after 5 days if the employee has a negative test, symptoms are
               improving, and they wear a face covering at work for an additional 5 days. Otherwise,
               most employees can return after 10 days. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Definitions:</span>
               <span class="q">“Close contact”</span> and <span class="q">“infectious period”</span> are
               now defined so that their meaning will change if CDPH changes its definition of the
               term in a regulation or order. </span></li>
