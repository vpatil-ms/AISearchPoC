      <p class="p">Florida has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 898) establishing new background check requirements for employees at certain apartment buildings. This takes effect immediately.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2><p class="p">Senate Bill 898 covers public lodging establishments that can be classified as the following under <a class="xref" href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0500-0599/0509/Sections/0509.242.html" target="_blank">state law</a>:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Nontransient: A building or complex of buildings in which 75 percent or more of the units are available for rent to tenants for stays longer than a month.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Transient: A building or complex of buildings in which more than 25 percent of the units are advertised or held out to the public as available for occupancy for stays shorter than a month. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Beginning July 1, 2022, covered landlords must require that each employee undergo a background screening as a condition of employment. The background screening must:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Be performed by a consumer reporting agency in accordance with the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Include a screening of criminal history records and sexual predator and sexual offender registries of all 50 states and the District of Columbia. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Under the law, a landlord may disqualify an individual from employment if they have been convicted or found guilty of, or entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, regardless of adjudication, any of the following offenses:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A criminal offense involving disregard for the safety of others which, if committed in this state, is a felony or a misdemeanor of the first degree or, if committed in another state, would be a felony or a misdemeanor of the first degree if committed in this state.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A criminal offense committed in any jurisdiction which involves violence, including, but not limited to, murder, sexual battery, robbery, carjacking, home-invasion robbery, and stalking. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The law also amends rules regarding room keys effective January 1, 2023 and makes other changes. See the <a class="xref" href="http://laws.flrules.org/2022/222" target="_blank">text of the law</a> for details.</p>
