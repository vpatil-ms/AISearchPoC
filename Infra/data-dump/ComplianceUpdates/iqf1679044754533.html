            providing clarification for employers.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="iqf1679044754533__section_N10049_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The OED <a class="xref" href="https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/displayDivisionRules.action?selected=" target="_blank">rules</a> clarify various aspects of the PFMLI
            program, such as the use of certain types of leave, what verification is needed, and
            various employee and employer requirements.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Covered Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The rules clarify certain situations on when an employee can take the
            following leaves:</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">New Child Bonding Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">When the new child bonding period crosses two benefit years, the maximum
            combined total of new child bonding leave between the two years for the one child is 12
            weeks. The rules prohibit an employee from taking 12 weeks of family leave in one year
            and 12 weeks of family leave (24 weeks) in the following year for one child, even if
            both proposed absences would fall within 12 months of the child's birth, placement or
            adoption.</p>

         <p class="p">However, when an employee takes bonding leave for two or more children,
            the combined amount of family leave during the two benefit years may exceed 12 weeks.
            For example, if an employee has twins, the employee may take up to 12 weeks of leave for
            a child during the first benefit year and may also take up to 12 weeks of leave for the
            other child in the second benefit year.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Serious Health Condition:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employees may use family leave to provide physical and psychological
            assistance to a family member with a serious health condition.</p>

         <p class="p">Physical assistance includes attending to basic medical, activities of
            daily living, safety, or nutritional needs when a family member cannot provide
            self-care; or, transporting the family member to a health care provider when the
            individual cannot transport themselves.</p>

         <p class="p">Psychological assistance includes providing comfort, reassurance, or
            companionship; completing the family member's administrative tasks; or, arranging for
            changes to a family member's care, including transfer to a nursing home.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employee Intermittent Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Under existing law, employees may claim leave benefits in increments
            equivalent to one workday or one workweek. The rules clarify that employees may use this
            time in consecutive or nonconsecutive periods of leave and increments that equal one
            workday or one workweek.</p>

         <p class="p">For a leave of less than one workweek, an employee can take leave equal
            to the average number of workdays they typically work. The weekly benefit for this time
            will be prorated based on the number of workdays of leave the employee takes in the
            workweek. To calculate the workday benefit amount, divide the weekly benefit amount by
            the average number of workdays the employee would typically work in a workweek.</p>

         <p class="p">Additionally, under the rules, employees with more than one employer
            must have their leave for a workday or workweek taken from all employers. As an example,
            if an employee works for different employers in the morning and afternoon but only needs
            to take leave during the morning or afternoon, the employee would not qualify for PFMLI
            benefits.</p>

         <p class="p">And, if an employee splits a four-day workweek equally between two
            employers, the employee cannot work for either employer during that time to qualify for
            a workweek of PFMLI benefits.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Verifying Benefit Eligibility:</span></p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">New Child Bonding Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">An employee must provide verification for new child bonding leave that
            reflects the employee's name as parent or guardian of the child after the birth or
            placement of the child through adoption or foster care, the child's name, and the date
            of the child's birth or placement.</p>

         <p class="p">Types of verification may include:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="iqf1679044754533__ul_cxy_jwk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">The child's birth certificate or other documents issued by the child
               or pregnant employee's health care provider; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A copy of a court order that verifies placement or documents from
               the foster care, adoption agency, or social worker involved in the placement
               confirming the placement. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Serious Health Condition:</span></p>

         <p class="p">An employee seeking medical or family leave must provide verification of
            the following, in addition to their own or a family member's personal information:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="iqf1679044754533__ul_c4k_3wk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">The relevant health care provider and their type of medical practice
               or specialization and contact information; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The approximate date the serious health condition began; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A reasonable estimate of the duration of the condition or its
               recovery period; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A reasonable estimate of the frequency and duration of the
               intermittent leave and estimated treatment schedule (if applicable). </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Safe Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">To take safe leave, an employee must provide verification, which can
            include:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="iqf1679044754533__ul_jzd_gwk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">A copy of a police report or a formal complaint that indicates an
               employee or their child was a victim of domestic violence, harassment, sexual assault
               or stalking; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A protective order or other evidence from a court or agency that the
               claimant or child appeared in (or was preparing for) a related proceeding; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Documentation from an attorney, health care provider, law
               enforcement officer, licensed mental health professional or counselor, member of the
               clergy, or victim services provider that the individual or child was undergoing
               related treatment or counseling, obtaining services, or relocating. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <div class="note note" id="iqf1679044754533__note_kzd_gwk_wwb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The rules provide an exception to the verification requirements if an
               employee can demonstrate good cause. For instance, if an employee has difficulty
               procuring the required verification because they lack access to services or have
               concerns for the safety of the claimant or their child. In this case, the employee
               can provide a written statement attesting they are taking qualifying leave.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p">Employees may also be required to provide additional verification to
            establish eligibility or qualify for benefits. Upon receiving a mailed request for
            information, they must respond within 14 days from the date of the request. If the
            request is delivered by telephone message, email, or other electronic methods, the
            employer must respond within 10 days.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employee Notice Requirements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The rules clarify that, in addition to <a class="xref" href="/oregon-adopts-paid-leave-program" target="_blank">existing
               notice requirements</a>, employees are not required to expressly mention PFMLI
            when they provide notice. Written notice may include handwritten or typed electronic
            communications, such as email and text messages, consistent with an employer's known,
            reasonable and customary policies.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employer Notice Requirements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers requiring written notice may require employees to provide the
            type of leave, the anticipated timing and duration, and an explanation of the need for
            leave.</p>

         <p class="p">Additionally, an employer must outline their written notice requirements
            in a written policy and procedures and provide a copy to every eligible employee at the
            time of hire and each time the policy and procedure change.</p>

         <p class="p">The rules clarify that the policy must also include a description of the
            penalties (a 25% reduction in an employee's first weekly benefit amount) that the state
            may impose if an employee does not comply with the employer's notice requirements.</p>

         <p class="p">PFMLI Contribution Rates:</p>

         <p class="p">Beginning January 1, 2023, Oregon employers with 25 or more employees
            (including those out of state) will pay 40%, and Oregon employees will pay 60% of the 1%
            of the contribution rate to the PFMLI fund.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers must submit an Equivalent Plan Application or a <a class="xref" href="https://paidleave.oregon.gov/DocumentsForms/Paid-Leave-Declaration-Intent-Printable-EN.pdf" target="_blank">Declaration of Intent</a> (see below) by November

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employee Benefit Entitlements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employee benefit entitlements will be based on the employee and the

            amounts.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employee Benefits Application Process:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Beginning <span class="ph strong">September 3, 2023</span>, employees may
            apply for PFMLI benefits through the OED up to 30 calendar days before or after their
            leave start date. The OED will notify employers when an employee has applied for
            benefits. Under the rules, an employer may respond to the OED's notification if their
            employee did not provide the required notice of their need for leave.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Approved Equivalent Plans:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employees working for an equivalent-plan employer and employers that
            provide paid leave benefits equal to or greater than the PFMLI program do not have to
            pay contributions.</p>

         <p class="p">Equivalent plans must provide equal to or greater than the PFMLI
            program's benefits to full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees.
            Additionally, these plans may not be more restrictive or cost employees more than the
            base rate established by the OED.</p>

         <p class="p">The OED has provided a <a class="xref" href="https://paidleave.oregon.gov/Documents/PaidLeave-EquivalentPlanChecklist-EN.pdf" target="_blank">checklist</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://paidleave.oregon.gov/Documents/Paid-Leave-Oregon-Equivalent-Plan-Guidebook-EN-September-2022.pdf" target="_blank">guidebook</a> to assist employers with equivalent
            plans.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employer Applications:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The OED has released equivalent plan applications for employers already
            offering paid leave to employees or those considering offering such leave. Applications
            cost $250 (non-refundable) and are accessible through the OED's <a class="xref" href="https://www.oregon.gov/employ/frances/Pages/default.aspx/" target="_blank">online portal</a> or a printable <a class="xref" href="https://paidleave.oregon.gov/DocumentsForms/Paid-Leave-EquivalentPlan-Application-Printable-EN.pdf" target="_blank">form</a>.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers should allow at least 30 days for a decision on an
            application. If the OED denies an application, an employer must continue collecting and
            paying PFMLI contributions. However, they may submit an appeal to the OED or the <a class="xref" href="https://www.oregon.gov/OAH/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Oregon Office of Administrative Hearings</a>.</p>

         <p class="p">For the first three years, employers must reapply for the approval of
            their plans on an annual basis or if they make substantive changes to an approved plan.
            After three years, their plans will remain in effect until withdrawn or terminated.</p>
