      <p class="p">The state of Washington has enacted legislation (House Bill 1097) that
         amends existing health and safety law. House Bill 1097 takes effect on <span class="ph strong">July 25, 2021</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="lfg1672211790206__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The state of Washington requires employers to comply with general safety <a class="xref" href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/Rcw/default.aspx?cite=49.17.060" target="_blank">standards</a>, including providing each employee with a place of employment that is free from recognized hazards. Employers that violate the law may be subject to penalties.</p>

      <section class="section" id="lfg1672211790206__section_N10059_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">House Bill 1097:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">House Bill 1097 adds additional employee protections, offers employers
            health and safety grants during a public emergency, and establishes a timeframe for
            employers to contest alleged health and safety violations.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Contesting a Violation:</span></p>

         <p class="p">An employer may contest an alleged health and safety violation within 10
            working days by submitting an application to the superior court in the county in which
            the alleged violation occurred.</p>

         <p class="p">If the state believes an employer violated a safety order that
            immediately restrains a practice or policy in the workplace, the state will notify the
            employer of such violation and of the penalty to be assessed. The employer will have 15
            workdays from receipt of the notification to appeal.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employer Grants:</span></p>

         <p class="p">During a state of emergency, the state will adopt a safety grant program
            to provide eligible employers with one-time grants to buy equipment, gear, or make
            capital improvements to meet any new safety and health requirements required before they
            can resume business operations. To be eligible, the purchase may not be covered by
            another grant, government program, or insurance contract and an employer must pay
            premiums to the state accident fund, not be self-insured, and have 25 or fewer full-time
            equivalent employees.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Expanded Employee Protections:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Under House Bill 1097, employers cannot take any action that would deter
            a reasonable employee from exercising their rights under the law. In addition, any
            employee who believes that they've been discharged or otherwise discriminated against in
            violation of the law may file a discrimination complaint with the state within 90 days.
            Previously, employees had 30 days to file such a complaint.</p>
