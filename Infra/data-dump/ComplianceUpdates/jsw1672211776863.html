      <p class="p">California has enacted legislation (Assembly Bill 2257) that clarifies and broadens the exceptions to the ABC test for determining whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee. Assembly Bill 2257 takes effect immediately.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jsw1672211776863__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Dynamex Decision:</span></p>
<p class="p">In 2018, the California Supreme Court ruled (see <a class="xref" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12156401043773771981&amp;q=dynamex%20vs%20superior%20court%20california&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6%2c31" target="_blank"><cite class="cite">Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior
                  Court</cite></a>) that the ABC test should be used to determine whether a
            worker is an independent contractor or an employee for purposes of coverage under the
            state's Wage Orders. The Wage Orders address minimum wage, overtime, meal and rest
            breaks, and related issues across various industries and cover employees, but not bona
            fide independent contractors.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">ABC Test:</span></p>
<p class="p">Under the ABC test, a worker must be considered an employee unless all three of the following factors are met:</p>
<ol class="concept">
            <li><span class="li">The worker is <span class="ph strong">free from the control and
                  direction</span> of the hirer in connection with the performance of the work, both
               under the contract for the performance of such work and in fact; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The worker performs work that is <span class="ph strong">outside
                  the usual course</span> of the hiring entity's business; and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The worker is <span class="ph strong">customarily engaged in an
                  independently established trade, occupation, or business</span> of the same nature
               as the work performed for the hiring entity. </span></li>

         </ol>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Assembly Bill 5:</span></p>
<p class="p">Effective January 1, 2020, Assembly Bill 5 codified the <span class="ph em">Dynamex</span> decision and made clear that the ABC test also applies to the
            provisions of the Labor Code and Unemployment Insurance. Thus, if the worker fails to
            meet the ABC test, the employer must treat them as an employee who is covered by not
            only the Wage Orders but also the Labor Code (e.g., paid sick leave, paid family leave,
            workers' compensation) and Unemployment Insurance.</p>
<p class="p">Assembly Bill 5 included several types of business relationships and occupations
            that are exempt from the ABC test, including business-to-business, referral agency, and
            professional services businesses. The exempt business relationships and occupations are
            generally subject to a multifactor independent contractor test under which no single
            factor is determinative and the unique circumstances of each case are weighed and
            balanced. This is known as the <span class="ph em">Borello test</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jsw1672211776863__section_N1007A_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Assembly Bill 2257:</h2><p class="p">Effective immediately, Assembly Bill 2257 amends and clarifies the business-to-business, referral agency, and professional services exemptions from the ABC test. It also adds occupations to the list of those that qualify for exemption, including:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Certain occupations in connection with creating, marketing, promoting, or distributing sound recordings or musical compositions. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A musician or musical group for the purpose of a single-engagement live performance event, unless certain conditions apply. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An individual performance artist presenting material that is their original work and creative in character and the result of which depends primarily on the individual's invention, imagination, or talent, if certain conditions are satisfied. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Individuals who provide underwriting inspections, premium audits, risk management, or loss control work are added to the exemption for occupations in connection with the insurance industry. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Home inspectors are added to the exemption for specified occupations governed by the Business and Professions Code. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Individual performance artists, manufactured housing salespersons, competition judges, and individuals engaged in international exchange visitor programs. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Certain conditions may need to be met for these business relationships and occupations to qualify for the exemption. See the <a class="xref" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2257" target="_blank">text of the law</a> for details and a full list of exemptions.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jsw1672211776863__section_N100A9_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">For purposes of determining whether a worker is covered under the state's Wage Orders, Labor Code, and Unemployment Insurance, California employers should apply the ABC test unless the occupation or business relationship is exempt, in which case a multifactor test may be required. If the worker fails to satisfy one or more parts of the ABC test, they must be treated as an employee. Employers who work with independent contractors may want to consult legal counsel to review those classifications.</p>
