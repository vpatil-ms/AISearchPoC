      <p class="p">The California Civil Rights Department (CRD) has announced that employers may request an extension to a new requirement to submit a separate pay data report on workers hired through labor contractors. The request must be submitted by May 10, 2023.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ruv1682597016804__section_jl2_kf3_jxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">By way of background, California requires a private employer that has 100 or more
            employees to submit a pay data report for its payroll employees each year. The state
            refers to this as the Payroll Employee Report. The report is due on or before the second
            Wednesday of May each year, beginning May 10, 2023.</p>

         <p class="p"> Beginning in 2023, a private employer that has 100 or more workers hired through labor
            contractors within the prior calendar year must submit a separate pay data report to the
            state covering those employees. The state refers to this as the Labor Contractor
            Employee Report. This separate report is due at the same time as the Payroll Employee
            Report.</p>

         <p class="p">However, the CRD has announced that employers may seek an extension to
            submit the Labor Contractor Employee Report. To seek an extension, an employer <span class="ph em">must</span> register in the <a class="xref" href="https://pdr.calcivilrights.ca.gov/s/" target="_blank">state
               portal</a> and fill out and submit a request form by May 10, 2023. If granted, the
            extension would last through July 10, 2023. The state is referring to requests for
            extensions as <span class="q">“enforcement deferral requests.”</span></p>

         <p class="p">The employer itself must submit the request. The CRD won't consider a request submitted
            by a third party on behalf of an employer, such as a Professional Employer Organization
            (PEO).</p>

            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Extensions aren't available for the Payroll Employee Report. Those reports are still
               due on or before May 10, 2023.</p>
