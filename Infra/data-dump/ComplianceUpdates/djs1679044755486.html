      <p class="p">On October 13, 2022, the Social Security Administration (SSA) announced the 2023 wage base. The annual wage base limit is the maximum amount of employee wages that are subject to the social security tax for the calendar year.</p>

      <section class="section" id="djs1679044755486__section_c2f_x4k_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The 2023 social security wage base will be $160,200, which is an increase of $13,200
            from $147,000 in 2022.</p>

         <p class="p">There is no limit to the wages subject to the Medicare tax and therefore all covered
            wages are subject to the 1.45% tax. As in 2022, wages paid in excess of $200,000 in 2023
            will be subject to an extra 0.9% Medicare tax withholding that will only be withheld
            from employees' wages as employers do not pay the extra tax. Married couples filing
            jointly with earned income of more than $250,000 will also be subject to the additional
            0.9% tax.</p>

         <p class="p">The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax rate, which is the combined social
            security tax rate of 6.2% of covered wages (up to the social security wage base) and the
            Medicare tax rate of 1.45% (on all covered wages), will be 7.65% for 2023. The maximum
            social security tax employees and employers will each pay in 2023 is $9,932.40. This is
            an increase of $818.40 from $9,114.00 in 2022.</p>

      <section class="section" id="djs1679044755486__section_mbj_x4k_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Next Steps:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Effective for wages paid on or after January 1, 2023, employers must withhold FICA taxes
            as outlined above.</p>
