      <p class="p">North Dakota has enacted legislation (HB 1511) that requires private employers to allow certain employee exemptions from the COVID-19 vaccine. The law is effective from November 15, 2021 to August 1, 2023, unless extended.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">North Dakota had enacted House Bill 1465, which generally prohibits a state government entity from requiring employers to obtain physical or electronic documentation to certify an individual's vaccination status, presence of antigens, pathogens or antibodies, or post-transmission recovery status before their employment.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2><p class="p">Under the new law, if an employer or contractor requires an employee, prospective employee, or independent contractor to be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a condition of employment, the employer must allow the following exemptions:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Proof of COVID-19 antibodies, which is valid for six months from the date of the antibody test; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Submission to periodic COVID-19 tests; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A certificate from a North Dakota licensed physician, physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse stating the physical condition of the individual is such that immunization would endanger the life or health of the individual; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A certificate signed by the individual stating the individual's religious, philosophical, or moral beliefs are opposed to such immunization. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The exemption process does not apply to the extent an employer or an independent contractor is required to comply with federal law, rules, or guidance relating to requirements for vaccinations for COVID-19.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Next Steps:</h2><p class="p">North Dakota employers should consult with legal counsel to discuss the impact of the mandate on their vaccination policies and practices.</p>
