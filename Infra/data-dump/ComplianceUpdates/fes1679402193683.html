      <p class="p">Seattle, Washington has passed legislation (Council Bill 120511), which adds caste as a protected characteristic under Seattle law. Council Bill 120511 takes effect on March 23, 2023.</p>

      <section class="section" id="fes1679402193683__section_igj_nl3_jxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The <a class="xref" href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT14HURI_CH14.04FAEMPR" target="_blank">Seattle Fair Employment Practices Ordinance</a> protects
            employees from being discriminated against on the basis of protected characteristics
            such as age, race, religion, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration
            status, sex, and marital status, among others. The law covers all employers, a designee
            of the employer, or a person acting in the interest of an employer.</p>

         <p class="p">Council Bill 120511 adds caste as a protected characteristic under the Seattle Fair
            Employment Practices Ordinance and provides the following definitions:</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Caste:</span> A system of rigid social
            stratification characterized by hereditary status, endogamy, and social barriers
            sanctioned by custom, law, or religion (a division of people on the basis of their birth
            or descent).</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Discrimination:</span> Any act, by itself or as
            part of a practice, that is intended to or results in different treatment or
            differentiates between or among individuals or groups of individuals by a protected
            characteristic under the law. It includes racial and sexual harassment and harassment
            based on other protected characteristics.</p>

      <section class="section" id="fes1679402193683__section_mr1_ll3_jxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Nondiscrimination Protections</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Council Bill 120511 prohibits covered employers from taking actions that indicate a
            preference, limitation, specification or discrimination based on a protected
            characteristic. This includes printing, circulating, or causing to be printed,
            published, or circulated, a statement, advertisement or publication related to
            employment or membership.</p>

         <p class="p">However, the law allows employers to collect data on protected characteristics to:</p>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Employers that are found in violation of the law may be required to:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="fes1679402193683__ul_tdy_ll3_jxb">
            <li><span class="li">Reinstate an employee to their full position and benefits (such as a promotion); </span></li>
