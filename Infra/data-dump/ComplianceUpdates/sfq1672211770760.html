      <p class="p">Oregon has enacted a temporary rule that expands the Oregon Family Leave Act (OFLA) to cover certain situations that may arise as a result of COVID-19. The rule is in effect from March 18, 2020 through at least September 13, 2020.</p>

      <section class="section" id="sfq1672211770760__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The OFLA requires employers with 25 or more employees to provide eligible workers with unpaid,
            job protected leave to care for themselves or family members in certain circumstances.
            Generally, to be eligible for leave, an employee must be employed for the 180 day
            calendar period immediately preceding the leave and have worked at least an average of
            25 hours per week during the 180-day period, though there are some <a class="xref" href="https://www.oregon.gov/boli/TA/docs/OFLA-Poster.pdf" target="_blank">exceptions</a>.</p>
<p class="p">Under existing rules, OFLA permits eligible employees to use up to 12 weeks of sick-child leave to care for a child with a non-serious health condition who requires home care and certain other reasons.</p>
