      <section class="section" id="dqa1679402193545__section_sbh_wl3_jxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Washington's long-term care benefits program, <span class="q">“WA Cares,”</span> was set to begin on
            January 1, 2022. Under the program, employers were to deduct a .58 percent premium from
            employee wages and remit that premium to Washington's Employment Security Department
               (<span class="q">“ESD”</span>).</p>

         <p class="p">WA Cares covered all employees employed in Washington State except certain collective
            bargaining employees, self-employed workers, and individuals who bought private
            long-term insurance to qualify for a one-time limited exemption.</p>

         <p class="p">In November of 2021, a lawsuit (<cite class="cite">Pacific Bells, et al. v.
               Inslee</cite>) was filed, stating that WA Cares violated ERISA and other federal
            laws. The case was dismissed, but to address concerns, Washington passed <a class="xref" href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1732&amp;Year=2021" target="_blank">House Bill 1732</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1733&amp;Year=2021" target="_blank">House Bill 1733</a>, which:</p>

      <section class="section" id="dqa1679402193545__section_zvw_xl3_jxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employer requirements</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Starting July 1, 2023, employers must withhold a <span class="q">“premium”</span> of .58 percent of an
            employee's wages unless the employee provided them with a state-issued exemption
            letter.</p>

         <p class="p">An employer must stop withholding from the employee by the effective date of the letter
            (or immediately if provided after the effective date) once it is received. Otherwise,
            the employer is liable to the employee. Washington will not return funds that are
            improperly withheld.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="dqa1679402193545__note_d2x_sl3_jxb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The .58 percent premium is intended to be a state tax on employee wages, not a
               premium. The law caps the tax rate at .58 percent of wages, which cannot be increased
               without legislative action.</p>

      <section class="section" id="dqa1679402193545__section_N100C4_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employer requirements</h2>
         
         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Eligible wages</span></p>

         <p class="p">Wages that are subject to the tax are uncapped. All wages and remuneration (stock-based
            compensation, bonuses, paid time off, severance pay, etc.) are subject to the tax.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Benefits</span></p>

         <p class="p">Benefits will be payable on July 1, 2026. An eligible individual deemed by the
            Department of Social and Health Services to require assistance with at least three
            activities of daily living will receive up to $100 per day (up to a maximum lifetime
            limit of $36,500).</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">WA Cares benefit qualification
               requirements</span></p>

         <p class="p">Washington residents will receive full benefits if they have paid the tax for:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="dqa1679402193545__ul_e2x_sl3_jxb">
            <li><span class="li">Ten years without interruption of five or more consecutive years; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Three of the last six years before applying for the benefits </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">WA Cares benefit qualification
               requirements</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employees born before January 1, 1968, who have not satisfied these requirements will
            receive a pro-rated 10% of the benefit amount for each year the tax is paid if they
            contributed to WA Cares for at least one year and worked at least 500 hours in that
            year.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employees subject to the tax</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employees must pay the WA Cares tax if their service is located in Washington or they
            perform some services in Washington that are directed or controlled from Washington (if
            the service is not localized in any state).</p>

         <div class="note note" id="dqa1679402193545__note_f2x_sl3_jxb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employees subject to Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML) will be subject to WA
               Cares.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Exceptions:</span> The tax does not apply to
            self-employed workers, federal employees, and employees that qualify for an
            exemption.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Self-employed worker opt-in option</span></p>

         <p class="p">Self-employed workers are automatically exempt from WA Cares. To participate in the
            program, they must opt in no later than July 1, 2026, or within three years of becoming
            self-employed for the first time. Once the option is elected, they cannot withdraw from
            coverage.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employees exempt from the tax</span></p>

         <p class="p">Workers that qualify for an exemption and want to opt out of the program (except
            self-employed workers) must apply to and receive an exemption from ESD and provide the
            state-issued exemption letter to their employer.</p>

         <p class="p">The following employees may apply to ESD for an exemption:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="dqa1679402193545__ul_g2x_sl3_jxb">
            <li><span class="li">An employee of an employer in Washington who has a permanent address outside of
               Washington as their primary residence; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employee who holds a nonimmigrant visa for temporary workers, under federal law,
               and is employed by an employer in Washington; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A veteran who is rated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs as having a
               service connected disability of 70 percent or greater (they receive a permanent
               exemption); or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A spouse or registered domestic partner of an active-duty service member in the
               United States armed forces (deployed or stationed outside of Washington). </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">An employee must notify the ESD and their employer <span class="ph em">within 90 days of a status change</span> that causes them to no longer meet the
            exemption requirements. Failure to provide timely notice will result in the employee
            being liable for the premium and interest.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="dqa1679402193545__note_h2x_sl3_jxb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The exemption period expired for most workers. Employees that bought private
               long-term care insurance by November 1, 2021, and applied for an exemption by
               December 31, 2022, should have received their exemption letters and provided them to
               their employers.</p>
