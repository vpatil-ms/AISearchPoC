<p class="p">To be covered by the ordinance, an employer must have 10 or more employees in the city of Berkeley and be:</p>
<ul class="ul">

                  Employees</span></span></p>
<p class="p">To be covered by the ordinance, an employee must:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Be entitled to the minimum wage under state law. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Perform at least two hours of work within the geographic boundaries of the city for an employer. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong"><span class="ph strong">Good Faith
                  Estimate</span></span></p>
<p class="p">An employer must provide each employee with a good faith estimate in writing of the employee's work schedule. The employee may submit a written request to modify the estimated work schedule, and the covered employer in its sole discretion may accept or reject the request, and must notify the employee of the covered employer's determination in writing prior to or on commencement of employment.</p>
<p class="p">A covered employer must provide its employees with at least two weeks' notice of their work schedules by doing one of the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Posting the work schedule in a conspicuous place at the workplace that is readily accessible and visible to all employees; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Transmitting the work schedule by electronic means, so long as all employees are given access to the electronic schedule at the workplace. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">For new employees, a covered employer must provide the new employee prior to or on their first day of employment with an initial work schedule. Thereafter, the covered employer must include the new employee in an existing schedule with other employees.</p>
<div class="note note" id="euz1679051361472__note_N1009B_N10040_N10039_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>An employee who is a victim of domestic violence or sexual violence may request that the employee's work schedule not be posted or transmitted to other employees.</p>
</div>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong"><span class="ph strong">Schedule
                  Changes</span></span></p>
<p class="p">A covered employer must provide an employee written notice of any change to the employee's posted or transmitted work schedule within 24 hours of a schedule change. This notice requirement doesn't apply to any employee-initiated schedule changes.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong"><span class="ph strong">Right to
                  Decline</span></span></p>
<p class="p">With limited exceptions, an employee has the right to decline any previously unscheduled hours that the covered employer adds to the employee's schedule, and for which the employee has been provided advance notice of less than 14 days before the first day of any new schedule.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong"><span class="ph strong">Right to
                  Additional Hours</span></span></p>
<p class="p">Before hiring a new employee, the employer must first offer additional hours of work to existing part-time employee(s) who have worked for more than two weeks, if the part-time employee(s) are qualified to do the additional work, as reasonably and in good faith determined by the covered employer, and if the additional hours needed are not the same hours the part-time employee is scheduled to work. This provision shouldn't be construed to require any employer to offer employees work hours paid at a premium rate under <a class="xref" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;sectionNum=510." target="_blank">Labor Code Section 510</a> nor to prohibit any employer from offering such work hours.</p>
<p class="p">A part-time employee has 24 hours to accept an offer of additional hours, after which time the covered employer may hire new employees to work the additional hours.</p>
<p class="p">A part-time employee who wishes to accept the additional hours must do so in writing.</p>
<p class="p">When a covered employer is required to offer additional hours to existing part-time employees, the covered employer must make the offer either in writing or by posting the offer in a conspicuous location in the workplace or electronically where notices to employees are customarily posted.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong"><span class="ph strong">Predictability
                  Pay</span></span></p>
<p class="p">With limited exceptions, covered employers must provide an employee with the following compensation per shift for each previously scheduled shift that the covered employer adds or subtracts hours, moves to another date or time, cancels, or for each previously unscheduled shift that the covered employer adds to the employee's schedule.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">When less than 14 days of notice but 24 hours or more of notice is given to the employee: one hour of predictability pay; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When less than 24 hours of notice is given to the employee: <ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">When hours are cancelled or reduced: four hours or the number of cancelled or reduced hours in the employee's scheduled shift, whichever is less. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">For additions and all other changes: one hour of predictability pay. The compensation required by this subsection shall be in addition to the employee's regular pay for working such shift. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Under the ordinance, predictability pay is paid at the employee's <span class="q">“regular rate of pay.”</span> Predictability pay isn't required in the following situations.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Mutually agreed-upon work shift swaps or coverage arrangements among employees; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employee initiated voluntary shift modifications, such as voluntary requests to leave a scheduled shift prior to the end of the shift or to use sick leave, vacation leave, or other policies offered by the employer; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To accommodate the following transitions in shifts: <ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">If an employee works no more than thirty minutes past the end of a scheduled shift to complete service to a customer, provided the employee is compensated at their regular rate of pay for the additional work performed by the employee. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">An employee begins or ends their scheduled shift no more than ten minutes prior to or after the scheduled shift, provided the employee is compensated at their regular rate of pay for the additional work performed by the employee. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When operations cannot begin or continue due to extreme acts of nature and certain other situations. See <a class="xref" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1feM4zFSpbkEQasiHWAVrxF4EqAE-47lF/view" target="_blank">the text of the ordinance</a> for details. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Rest Between Shifts</span></p>
<p class="p">An employee has the right to decline work hours that occur less than 11 hours</p>
<p class="p">after the end of the previous shift. An employee who agrees in writing to work hours despite this right must be compensated at one and one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay for any hours worked less than 11 hours following the end of a previous shift.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Right to Request a Flexible Working Arrangement</span></p>
<p class="p">An employee has the right to request a modified work schedule, including but not limited to additional shifts or hours; changes in days of work or start and/or end times for the shift; permission to exchange shifts with other employees; limitations on availability; part-time employment; job sharing arrangements; reduction or change in work duties; or part-year employment. An employer may accept, modify or decline the employee's request. A covered employer must not retaliate against an employee for exercising their rights under this provision.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Notice</span></p>
<p class="p">The city is required to publish and make available to covered employers, in English and in other languages as provided in any implementing regulations, a notice suitable for posting by covered employers in the workplace informing employees of their rights under the ordinance.</p>
<p class="p">Each covered employer must give written notification to each current employee, and to each new employee at time of hire, of their rights under the ordinance. Every covered employer must also provide each employee at the time of hire with the covered employer's name, address and telephone number in writing. The written notification must be in English and other languages as provided in any implementing regulations, and must also be posted prominently in areas at the work site where it will be seen by all employees.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Retaliation Prohibited</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers are prohibited from taking adverse action against any employee in retaliation for exercising rights protected under the ordinance.</p>
