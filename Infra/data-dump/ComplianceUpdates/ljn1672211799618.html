      <p class="p">The Illinois Department of Labor (IDOL) has begun rolling out a requirement for employers with 100 or more employees working in Illinois to obtain an Equal Pay Registration Certificate (EPRC) sometime between March 24, 2022 and March 23, 2024. Employers should receive a notice from the IDOL at least 120 days prior to their assigned registration deadline.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ljn1672211799618__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">In 2021, the Illinois Equal Pay Act (IEPA) was amended to require that private employers report certain payroll information to the IDOL and obtain an EPRC. The requirement applies to any private employer that has 100 or more employees in Illinois and is required to file an annual EEO-1 with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The IEPA defines employee as any individual permitted to work by an employer.</p>
<p class="p">The IDOL is assigning each employer a deadline by which it must submit its initial application for an EPRC. The deadline will be sometime between March 24, 2022 and March 23, 2024. Covered employers must also obtain an EPRC every two years thereafter. Employers should receive a notice from the IDOL at least 120 days prior to their assigned registration deadline. The IDOL has begun the process of sending out notices in waves. Some businesses may not receive their assigned registration date for over a year.</p>
<div class="note note" id="ljn1672211799618__note_N10054_N10048_N10041_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>This reporting requirement to IDOL does not impact the new reporting requirement under the Illinois Business Corporation Act (BCA), which requires that covered employers provide EEO-1 Section D data with their first annual report submitted to the Illinois Secretary of State on or after January 1, 2023 (see Other Reporting Requirements below).</p>

      <section class="section" id="ljn1672211799618__section_N1005B_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Details</h2><p class="p">To obtain an EPRC, the employer must:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Submit a copy of the business's most recently filed EEO-1 Report. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide a list of employees broken down by race, ethnicity, and gender. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Report employee-level data which includes: the total wages paid to each employee during the previous calendar year; the county in which the employee works; and dates of employment among other information. The IDOL has provided a <a class="xref" href="https://www2.illinois.gov/idol/Laws-Rules/CONMED/Documents/EPARC/EPARC-Employee-Import-Template.xls" target="_blank">template</a> for employers to use to collect the data. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Certify that: <ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">The business is in compliance with the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the Illinois Human Rights Act, the Equal Wage Act and the Illinois Equal Pay Act of 2003; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The average compensation for its female and minority employees isn't consistently below the average compensation for its male and nonminority employees within each of the job categories in the employer's EEO-1 report, taking into account factors such as length of service, job requirements, experience, skill, effort, responsibility, working conditions or other mitigating factors; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The business does not restrict employees of one sex to certain job classifications and does make retention and promotion decisions without regard to sex; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Wage and benefit disparities are corrected when identified to help ensure compliance with the laws referenced above; and </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Wages and benefits are evaluated to help ensure compliance with the laws referenced above, and how often they are evaluated. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Include in the statement an explanation of its compensation determinations and policies, such as whether the employer uses a market-pricing approach; prevailing wage; a performance pay system; internal analysis or another approach to determine wages and benefits. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Submit a $150 filing fee. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">If an employer doesn't currently have 100 or more employees, an EPRC isn't required. If an employer grows and their workforce reaches or surpasses 100, it must submit its contact information to the IDOL via <a class="xref" href="https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=nwgia7qOPEaE9TFxIQ-QBUNgjk8mwOhJgAcwbrynWX1UMEs4NDlYMzNQWUdUNjhaNFVVTEtOMTNDMCQlQCN0PWcu" target="_blank">this website</a>.</p>
<p class="p">Other Reporting Requirements:</p>
<p class="p">Under the Illinois BCA, Illinois corporations or foreign corporations authorized to transact business in the state (with certain exceptions) must file an annual report with the Illinois Secretary of State.</p>
<p class="p">The BCA has been amended to add a new reporting requirement that will take effect next year. Beginning with the first annual report submitted on or after January 1, 2023, if an employer is required to submit an EEO-1, they must include in their annual report to the Illinois Secretary of State the employment data reported under Section D of their EEO-1. This data includes a breakdown of employees by race, ethnicity and gender within the EEO-1 job categories. The Secretary of State will publish the data on its website.</p>
