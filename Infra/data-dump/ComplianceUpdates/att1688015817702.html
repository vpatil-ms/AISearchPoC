      <p class="p">Minnesota has enacted legislation (House File 100) that permits recreational cannabis use among adults age 21 and older beginning August 1, 2023. The law includes protections for off-duty cannabis use.</p>

      <section class="section" id="att1688015817702__section_sdx_gfp_yxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">House File 100 expressly adds cannabis to the state's definition of a <span class="q">“lawful
               consumable product,”</span> meaning an employer is prohibited from taking adverse action
            against an individual because of their use of cannabis or cannabis products outside of
            work during nonworking hours.</p>

         <p class="p">Unless otherwise provided by state or federal law, an employer isn't required to permit
            or accommodate cannabis use, possession, impairment, sale or transfer while an employee
            is working, or while an employee is on the employer's premises or operating the
            employer's vehicle, machinery or equipment.</p>

         <p class="p">An employer may only enact and enforce written work rules prohibiting cannabis use,
            possession, impairment, sale or transfer while an employee is working or while an
            employee is on the employer's premises or operating the employer's vehicle, machinery or
            equipment. The written policy must contain the minimum information required by the <a class="xref" href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/181.952" target="_blank">Minnesota Drug and Alcohol Testing in the Workplace Act</a>
            (DATWA), as amended.</p>

      <section class="section" id="att1688015817702__section_N10060_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Limitations on Discipline of Current Employees</h2><p class="p">House File 100 amends the DATWA to extend certain existing disciplinary protections. For example, effective August 1, 2023, the DATWA will require that instead of termination, employers must first offer counseling or rehabilitation to employees who test positive for cannabis for the first time.</p>
<p class="p">House File 100 also adds new protections specifically for cannabis. Under these provisions, an employer may only discipline, discharge or take other adverse personnel action against an employee for cannabis use, possession, impairment, sale or transfer while an employee is working on the employer's premises, or operating the employer's vehicle, machinery, or equipment as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">If, as the result of consuming cannabis, the employee doesn't possess that clearness of intellect and control of self that the employee otherwise would have; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If cannabis testing verifies the presence of cannabis following a confirmatory test; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">As provided in the employer's written work rules for cannabis and cannabis testing, provided that the rules are in writing and in a written policy that contains the minimum information required; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">As otherwise authorized or required under state or federal law or regulations, or if a failure to do so would cause an employer to lose a monetary or licensing-related benefit under federal law or regulations. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="att1688015817702__section_N10080_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Drug Testing Applicants</h2><p class="p">With limited exceptions, employers are prohibited from requesting or requiring a job applicant to undergo pre-employment cannabis testing solely for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of cannabis as a condition of employment, unless otherwise required by state or federal law.Unless otherwise required by state or federal law, employers are prohibited from refusing to hire a job applicant solely because the job applicant submits to a cannabis test and the results of the test indicate the presence of cannabis.</p>
