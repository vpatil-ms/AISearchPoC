      <p class="p">The United States Supreme Court has ruled in <a class="xref" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-984_j426.pdf" target="_blank">Helix Energy Solutions Group v. Hewitt</a> that an employee who made in excess of $200,000 annually was eligible for overtime pay due to the fact that the employee was paid on a daily basis.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wdy1679044762534__section_t5h_hql_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The plaintiff, Michael Hewitt from 2015-2017 worked on an offshore oil rig for 28 days
            straight working 12 hours daily. He was paid $963 to $1341 per day and earned $248,053
            in 2015 and $218,863 in 2016.</p>

         <p class="p">The employer (Helix) asserted that because Hewitt (1) was highly paid executive earning
            over $200,000 annually and (2) received the required weekly amount of pay at the time to
            be an exempt employee ($455 per week) that he was not eligible for overtime pay.</p>

         <p class="p">Hewitt argued that since he was paid on a daily basis and not on a salaried basis he
            should be eligible for overtime.</p>

         <p class="p">In its 6-3 decision, the Court ruled against Helix's assertion that Hewitt was not
            eligible for overtime based on the <span class="q">“Executive Exemption.”</span> One of the criteria
            necessary to be considered a bona fide executive is outlined in 29 CFR §541.100(a)(1) as
            follows:</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="q">“(a) The term ”</span>employee employed in a bona fide executive capacity" in section
            13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any employee:</p>

         <p class="p">(1) Compensated on a <span class="ph strong">salary basis</span>
            [emphasis added] pursuant to § 541.600 at a rate of not less than $684 * per week…"</p>

         <p class="p">*The rate at the time of the plaintiff's employment with Helix was $455 per week.</p>

         <p class="p">Salary basis is defined under 29 CFR § 541.602(a) in part as follows:</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph em"><span class="q">“General rule.”</span></span><span class="q">“ An employee will be considered to be paid on a ”</span>salary basis<span class="q">“ within the meaning of this part if the employee regularly receives
               each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent basis, a predetermined amount
               constituting all or part of the employee's compensation, which amount is not subject
               to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work
               performed.”</span></p>

         <p class="p">The Court in its majority opinion stated in part as follows:</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="q">“Helix did not pay Hewitt on a salary basis as defined in §602(a). That section
               applies solely to employees paid by the week (or longer); it is not met when an
               employer pays an employee by the day, as Helix paid Hewitt. Daily-rate workers, of
               whatever income level, are paid on a salary basis only through the test set out in
               §604(b) (which, again, Helix's payment scheme did not satisfy). Those conclusions
               follow from both the text and the structure of the regulations. And Helix's various
               policy claims cannot justify departing from what the rules say.”</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers who pay their employees via daily rate (regardless of amount) should review
            this case with their legal advisor to ensure they are following the rules of Fair Labor
            Standards Act in relation to overtime pay eligibility as decided by the Court.</p>
