      <p class="p">The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment has issued guidance that makes clear that all employers must provide paid leave to employees who need time off to receive the COVID-19 vaccination during the public health emergency.</p>

      <section class="section" id="hjl1672211786743__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">In 2020, Colorado enacted the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act of 2020 (HFWA). The HFWA included various leave requirements, including:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Paid sick leave:</span></p>
<p class="p">Effective January 1, 2021, employers with 16 or more employees must provide paid sick leave to their employees. Employers with 15 or fewer employees have until January 1, 2022 to comply. Paid sick leave must accrue at a rate of at least one hour for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 48 hours.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Public health emergency leave:</span></p>
<p class="p">In addition to the paid sick leave outlined above, <span class="ph em">all
               employers</span> must provide public health emergency leave (PHEL) effective January 1,
            2021. Employees who normally work 40 hours or more per week are entitled to at least 80
            hours of PHEL. Employees who normally work fewer than 40 hours in a week are entitled to
            at least the greater of either the amount of time the employee is scheduled to work in a
            14-day period or the amount of time the employee actually works during an average 14-day
            period.</p>
<p class="p">Employees may use PHEL for the following purposes:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">To self-isolate because they're diagnosed with, or experience symptoms of, the communicable illness that is the cause for the public health emergency; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To seek or obtain medical diagnosis, care, or treatment if experiencing symptoms associated with the communicable illness; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To seek preventive care concerning the communicable illness; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If local officials or the employee's employer determines that the individual's presence on the job or in the community would jeopardize the health of others because of the individual's exposure or because they're exhibiting symptoms of the communicable illness (regardless of diagnosis); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To care for a family member to whom any of the above applies; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To care for a child or other family member when the child's care provider is unavailable due to a public health emergency, or if the child's or family member's school or place of care has been closed due to a public health emergency, including if a school or place of care is physically closed but providing instruction remotely; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If an employee is unable to work because the employee has a health condition that may increase susceptibility to or risk of the communicable illness. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Employees are only eligible for PHEL once during the entirety of the public health emergency, even if it is amended, extended, restated, or prolonged. Employees may use PHEL until four weeks after the official public health emergency.</p>

Therefore, all employees are entitled to use their PHEL for the purposes of COVID-19 vaccination.</p>
