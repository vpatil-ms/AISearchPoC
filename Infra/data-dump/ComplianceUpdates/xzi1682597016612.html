      <p class="p">New York has released an updated model policy and training materials that address sexual harassment and discrimination prevention.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xzi1682597016612__section_zdp_vxr_byb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">By way of background, New York requires employers to:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="xzi1682597016612__ul_z32_wxr_byb">
            <li><span class="li">Adopt written sexual harassment prevention policies that meet or
               exceed the state's model policy's requirements. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide employees with information on the <a class="xref" href="/new-york-adds-workplace-protections-nyc-clarifies-pay-transparency-law" target="_blank">sexual harassment prevention hotline</a> and
               classify the release of certain employee information as retaliation. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The New York State Department of Labor (NYDOL) has <a class="xref" href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ny.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2023-04%2FSexualHarassmentModelPolicy.docx&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK" target="_blank">released</a> an updated model policy and trainings
            on sexual harassment and gender discrimination that apply to all protected classes.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xzi1682597016612__section_tbh_txr_byb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Key Model Policy Revisions</h2>
         
      </section>

      <section class="section" id="xzi1682597016612__section_N1006A_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Definitions</h2><p class="p">The policy defines sexual harassment as a form of gender-based discrimination and clarifies definitions that fall under gender diversity, such as cisgender, transgender and non-binary persons. See <a class="xref" href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ny.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2023-04%2FSexualHarassmentModelPolicy.docx&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK" target="_blank">the policy</a> for further details.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="xzi1682597016612__section_N1007B_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">New Provisions</h2><p class="p">The policy states that sexual harassment does not need to be severe or pervasive to be illegal in New York and that it can happen in a remote workplace.</p>
<p class="p">The model policy also:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">States that impact (not intent) matters in assessing a sexual harassment claim. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Clarifies that whether harassing conduct is <span class="q">“petty”</span> or <span class="q">“trivial”</span> is determined from the perspective of a reasonable victim of discrimination with the same protected characteristics under the New York State Human Rights Law. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provides examples of sexual harassment and retaliation. This includes intentionally misusing preferred pronouns and creating different expectations for individuals based on their perceived identities. See <a class="xref" href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ny.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2023-04%2FSexualHarassmentModelPolicy.docx&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK" target="_blank">the policy</a> for more examples. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Makes reference to the confidential sexual harassment prevention hotline, which launched in July 2022. </span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="xzi1682597016612__section_N100AA_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Supervisor Responsibilities</h2><p class="p">Under <a class="xref" href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ny.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2023-04%2FSexualHarassmentModelPolicy.docx&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK" target="_blank">the policy</a>, supervisors and managers should be aware of how investigations into sexual harassment can impact victims and must accommodate such victims to ensure the workplace is safe, supportive and free from retaliation during and after an investigation.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="xzi1682597016612__section_N100BB_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Bystander Intervention</h2><p class="p">The policy also includes methods to use if a bystander witnesses harassment or discrimination. Under the policy, a bystander can:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Interrupt the harassment (or ask a third party to help intervene, if they feel unsafe) by engaging with the person being harassed and distracting them from the harassment; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Record or take notes on the harassment incident to help in a future investigation; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Check in with the person who was harassed after the incident to see how they are feeling and reaffirm that the harassment was not ok; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If they feel safe to do so, confront any harassers and name the behavior as inappropriate. Note: When confronting harassment, physical assault is never appropriate. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="xzi1682597016612__section_N100D8_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Updated Model Training Materials</h2><p class="p">The NYDOL also updated its model training materials, which include a <a class="xref" href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ny.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2023-04%2FSexualHarassmentPreventionModelTrainingScript.docx&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK" target="_blank">script</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://www.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/SexualHarassmentPreventionTrainingSlides.pdf" target="_blank">slides</a> on preventing sexual harassment and discrimination. Key revisions to the trainings mirror much of the key revisions to the policy. The trainings also, among other things:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Acknowledge that the subject matter can be sensitive or difficult for some employees, including those that might have experienced harassment, discrimination or violence in the past. The instructions state that if the training is being facilitated in a group (whether in person or virtually), trainers should make clear to those attending that anyone needing to step out briefly on behalf of their mental health may do so. </span></li>

         </ul>
<div class="note note" id="xzi1682597016612__note_N100F6_N100D8_N10039_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>All employees need to complete the training, but an employee may complete the training at a later time if need be.</p>
</div>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Include an exercise on identifying examples of sex stereotyping. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide new scenario examples on the remote work environment and harassment that is based on gender identity. See <a class="xref" href="https://www.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/SexualHarassmentPreventionTrainingSlides.pdf" target="_blank">the training</a> for further details. </span></li>

         </ul>
<div class="note note" id="xzi1682597016612__note_N1010F_N100D8_N10039_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The NYDOL has posted <a class="xref" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9gudpiQ40M&amp;t=1s" target="_blank">a new training video</a> and other resources on its <a class="xref" href="https://www.ny.gov/combating-sexual-harassment-workplace/sexual-harassment-prevention-model-policy-and-training" target="_blank">website</a> to help employers navigate the updated policy requirements.</p>
</div>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="xzi1682597016612__section_mz3_yxr_byb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Next Steps</h2>
         
         <p class="p">New York employers should review and update their harassment prevention
            policies and training materials as soon as possible to align with the updated material
            provided by the state.</p>
