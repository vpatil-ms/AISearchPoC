      <p class="p">Fully vaccinated employees in California are generally no longer required to be excluded from the workplace if they have had COVID-19 exposure as long as they are asymptomatic, according to updated guidance from the Department of Industrial Relations (DIR).</p>

      <section class="section" id="ljv1672211786904__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">In 2020, the DIR <a class="xref" href="https://sbshrs.adpinfo.com/covid19-state-emergency-leave-laws#california" target="_blank">adopted emergency rules</a> related to protecting workers from COVID-19, including a requirement for employers to exclude employees with COVID-19 exposure for a certain length of time.</p>
<p class="p">On May 3, 2021, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) issued its <a class="xref" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Public-Health-Recommendations-for-Fully-Vaccinated-People.aspx" target="_blank">COVID-19 Public Health Recommendations for Fully Vaccinated People</a>, which provide that fully vaccinated individuals who have had a COVID-19 exposure don't need to quarantine if they are asymptomatic.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ljv1672211786904__section_N10063_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">New DIR Guidance:</h2><p class="p">Applying the CDPH's recommendations, the DIR has updated its guidance on the emergency rules to state that employers must exclude fully vaccinated employees only if they:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Are COVID-19 cases; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Have had a COVID-19 exposure and exhibit COVID-19 symptoms. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">This means that employers don't need to exclude fully vaccinated employees who had a COVID-19 exposure who are asymptomatic (and aren't considered a COVID-19 case), according to the guidance.</p>
<p class="p">Under the CDPH's recommendations, individuals are considered fully vaccinated for COVID-19:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Two weeks or more after they have received the second dose in a two-dose series (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna); or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Two weeks or more after they have received a single-dose vaccine (Johnson and Johnson [J&amp;J]/Janssen). </span></li>
