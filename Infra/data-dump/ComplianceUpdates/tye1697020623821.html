         <p class="p">Employers must also provide the amount of SST accrued and used during a pay period and
            an employee's total balance of accrued SST (this information may be reported on a pay
            statement or a separate written statement). Employers may also require reasonable
            advance notice of an employee's need to use SST.</p>

      <section class="section" id="tye1697020623821__section_N10105_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Final Rule</h2>
         <p class="p subHeading1">Calculating Employer Size</p>
<p class="p">The Final Rule requires employers to calculate headcount based on their total number of workers employed at any point in the U.S. during the calendar year to date.</p>
<p class="p">For purposes of counting employees:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Part-time employees are considered employed each working day of the calendar week. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employees jointly employed by more than one employer are counted by each employer, whether or not their names appear on the employer's payroll. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employees on paid or unpaid leave, including SST, leaves of absence, disciplinary suspension, or any other type of temporary absence, are counted as long as the employer has a reasonable expectation that the employee will later return to active employment. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The Final Rule also requires employers to immediately increase their employees' SST when the change in headcount requires the employer to provide more leave during the calendar year. For instance, if an employer's headcount increases from 75 to 115 employees (above 99 employees), the employer must allow their employees to use an additional 16 hours of SST (when applicable) for the remainder of the calendar year to reach the requisite 56 hours.</p>
<p class="p">However, if their headcount falls below 100 employees, employers are prohibited from reducing SST benefits until the following calendar year.</p>
<p class="p">Employers whose headcounts increase to an amount that requires them to provide additional paid SST are not required to retroactively pay employees for any previous, unpaid SST time that was already used by an employee.</p>
<p class="p">See the <a class="xref" href="https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DCWP-NOA-Earned-Safe-and-Sick-Time-Act.pdf" target="_blank">Final Rule</a> for additional details and examples.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Covered Employees</p>

         <p class="p">The Final Rule clarifies that:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="tye1697020623821__ul_v3l_5d3_hzb">
            <li><span class="li">All domestic workers are entitled to SST; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employee is entitled to SST if the employee: <ul class="ul" id="tye1697020623821__ul_w3l_5d3_hzb">
                  <li><span class="li">Physically performs work in New York City, regardless of where the employer is
                     located; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Performs remote work while physically located in New York City, regardless of
                     where the employer is located; or </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Primarily performs work outside of New York City, but regularly performs (or
                     is expected to regularly perform) work within New York City. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Examples in the <a class="xref" href="https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DCWP-NOA-Earned-Safe-and-Sick-Time-Act.pdf" target="_blank">Final Rule</a> clarify that only hours worked within New York
            City count as hours worked for the purposes of accruing and using SST under the
            ESSTA.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Fractional Accruals</p>

         <p class="p">The Final Rule indicates that employee accrual of SST must account for all time worked,
            regardless of whether time worked is less than a 30-hour increment. For the purposes of
            calculating accrual for time worked in increments of less than 30 hours, employers may
            round accrued SST to the nearest five minutes, or to the nearest one-tenth or quarter of
            an hour, provided that it will not result, over a period of time, in a failure to
            provide the proper accrual of SST to employees for all the time they have actually
            worked.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Rate of Pay Requirements</p>

         <p class="p">The Final Rule clarifies that an employer must pay an employee for SST at the employee's
            regular rate of pay at the time the SST is taken, provided that the rate of pay is the
            highest applicable rate of pay they would be entitled to under all applicable laws.</p>

         <p class="p">The Final rule indicates that if the employee uses SST during hours that would have been
            designated as overtime, the employer is not required to pay the overtime rate of pay.
            However, the employer may only deduct the number of hours of SST actually used by the
            employee from the employee's SST accruals, regardless of whether those hours would have
            been classified as straight-time or overtime hours.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers that have tipped employees are not required to pay employees for lost tips or
            gratuities but also cannot take a tip credit for hours that the employee is out on SST.
            Employers must pay all employees at least the full applicable minimum wage unless a
            higher applicable rate applies. See the <a class="xref" href="https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DCWP-NOA-Earned-Safe-and-Sick-Time-Act.pdf" target="_blank">Final Rule</a> for examples.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Notice of Safe/Sick Time Accruals and Use on Pay
            Statements</p>

         <p class="p">The Final Rule indicates that employers must report:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="tye1697020623821__ul_fh3_b23_hzb">
            <li><span class="li">The amount of SST accrued during the pay period. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The amount of SST used during the pay period. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The balance of SST available for use. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The Final Rule recognizes that an employee's total SST balance may be greater than the
            amount of SST the employee actually has available for use in that benefit year. When
            this occurs, the employer must still inform the employee of the amount of SST they have
            available to use in that year.</p>

         <p class="p">The Final Rule provides that employers can meet the reporting requirements by including
            the required information on pay statements or by providing other written documentation
            to employees every pay period.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Providing Required Information - Electronic Option</p>

         <p class="p">The Final Rule provides that the required accrual, usage and available balance
            information can be provided on a pay statement electronically or through other written
            documentation electronically if the electronic system:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="tye1697020623821__ul_qyw_d23_hzb">
            <li><span class="li">Alerts employees each pay period that their accrual, use and available balance
               information is available for review; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Makes the required information readily accessible for employees located outside of
               the workplace; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Makes the required accrual, use, and balance information for any past pay periods
               also readily accessible to employees outside of the workplace. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Employee Notice &amp; Policy Requirements</p>

         <p class="p">The Final Rule indicates that an employer may require an employee to provide reasonable
            notice of the need to use SST provided the requirement to provide notice and the method
            of providing notice are set forth in a written policy.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Unforeseeable SST</p>

         <p class="p">An employer that requires notice of the need to use SST where the need is not
            foreseeable must provide a written policy that contains reasonable procedures for the
            employee to provide notice as soon as <span class="q">“practicable.”</span></p>

         <p class="p"> Examples of such procedures may include, but are not limited to, instructing the
            employee to:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="tye1697020623821__ul_g3b_h23_hzb">
            <li><span class="li">Call a designated phone number at which an employee can leave a message; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Follow a uniform call-in procedure; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Send an email to a designated email address; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Submit a leave request in a scheduling software system, provided the employee has
               access to such system on non-work time, and has been trained on and given written
               instructions on how to use the system; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Use another reasonable and accessible means of communication identified by the
               employer. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Any procedures for employees to give notice of the need to use SST when the need is not
            foreseeable may not include any requirement that an employee appear in person at a
            worksite or deliver any document to the employer prior to using SST .</p>

         <p class="p">In determining when notice is <span class="q">“practicable”</span> in a given situation, an employer must
            consider the individual facts and circumstances of the situation.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Foreseeable SST</p>

         <p class="p">An employer that requires notice of the need to use SST where the need is foreseeable
            must have a written policy that contains procedures for the employee to provide
            reasonable notice, which may include any of the reasonable procedures bulleted above.
            The policy must not require more than seven days' notice prior to the date SST is to
            begin. Employers may require that such notice be in writing.</p>

         <p class="p">A need is foreseeable when the employee is aware of the need to use SST seven days or
            more before such use. Otherwise, the need is unforeseeable.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Documentation</p>

         <p class="p">As a reminder, under current law, an employer may require an employee to provide
            documentation that supports the need for SST if the leave lasts four or more consecutive
            workdays.</p>

         <p class="p">Under the Final Rule, employers requiring written documentation of an employee's leave
            under the ESSTA must:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="tye1697020623821__ul_esv_m23_hzb">
            <li><span class="li">Reimburse employees for all fees paid to a licensed provider to obtain SST
               documentation and all reasonable costs or expenses paid to obtain safe time
               documentation. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Include a statement of the requirement, the types of written documentation the
               employer will accept and instructions on how employees can submit the documentation
               to the employer in a written policy. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The Final Rule also clarifies:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="tye1697020623821__ul_fsv_m23_hzb">
            <li><span class="li">An employer is prohibited from requiring written documentation before the employee
               returns to work. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <div class="note note" id="tye1697020623821__note_gsv_m23_hzb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>If an employer requests such documentation, it must give the employee at least seven
               days to submit the documents.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Transfer of Employees</p>

         <p class="p">The Final Rule makes clear that business sales, transfers in ownership, and certain
            subcontracting changes won't impact employees' SST balances. Employers that do not
            properly transfer an employee's accrued SST to a successor employer may violate the law,
            and the original and successor employer (and any joint employers) may be held
            responsible.</p>

         <p class="p">Employees must be allowed to use and receive payment for unused and accrued SST from
            their former employer, if they were entitled to a larger amount of SST under the law at
            their former employer.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Enforcement</p>

         <p class="p">The Final Rule specifies employer actions that may violate the law. See the <a class="xref" href="https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DCWP-NOA-Earned-Safe-and-Sick-Time-Act.pdf" target="_blank">Final Rule</a> for further details and examples.</p>
