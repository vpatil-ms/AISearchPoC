      <p class="p">Massachusetts has issued amended regulations implementing the state's paid family and medical leave program.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ush1672211776332__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">In 2018, Massachusetts enacted legislation that requires all private employers with employees in the state to provide paid family and medical leave (PFML) to eligible employees beginning January 1, 2021. The program is funded by premiums paid by employees, employers with 25 or more employees, and the self-employed. Contributions to the program began on October 1, 2019.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Medical Leave:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employees are entitled to up to 20 weeks of paid leave in a benefit year for their own serious health condition, defined as an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care in a hospital, hospice or residential medical facility, or continuing treatment by a health care provider.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Family Leave:</span></p>
<p class="p">Eligible individuals are entitled to up to 12 weeks of paid leave in a benefit year to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Provide care for a family member with a serious health condition; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Bond with their child during the first 12 months after the child's birth or placement for adoption or foster care; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Attend to obligations arising because a family member is on active duty or has been notified of an impending call to active duty in the United States armed forces. </span></li>

         </ul>
<div class="note note" id="ush1672211776332__note_N1006C_N10048_N10041_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Eligible individuals are entitled to up to 26 weeks of family leave if it is to provide care for a family member who is a covered member or veteran of the armed forces who has an injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated while on active duty.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">No family or medical leave benefits are payable during the first seven calendar days after the date the leave begins.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ush1672211776332__section_N10076_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Amended Regulations:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The amended regulations define key terms and clarify various aspects of
            the law. Here's an overview of some the changes.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Intermittent Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The amended regulations clarify that intermittent leave must be taken in
            increments consistent with the employer's established policy to account for use of other
            forms of leave, but the state won't pay benefits in increments of less than 15 minutes.
            A covered worker won't be permitted to apply for payment for PFML benefits associated
            with intermittent leave until they have eight hours of accumulated leave time, unless
            more than 30 calendar days has lapsed since the initial taking of such leave.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Job Protection:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The regulations clarify that employees are entitled to job protection
            immediately following the first date on which they begin any type of leave that is
            associated with a qualifying reason, regardless of whether an application for benefits
            has been submitted to the state or whether that leave is paid or unpaid. In addition,
            employees who don't file an application for PFML benefits with the state, but use any
            other type of leave (including accrued paid leave or unpaid leave approved by an
            employer; temporary disability leave available from their employer; leave under an
            employer's paid family or medical leave policy; or extended illness leave bank provided
            by an employer) taken for a qualifying reason, will be entitled to job protected leave
            as of the date of commencing such leave and the leave will run concurrently with
            PFML.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="ush1672211776332__note_N1008C_N10077_N10041_N10001"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Covered individuals who are approved for leave benefits by the state
               may choose to use accrued paid leave provided by their employer rather than receive a
               paid PFML benefit. This leave provided by an employer runs concurrently with PFML. If
               employees choose employer-provided paid leave instead of PFML benefits, employers are
               required to inform them that the use of this leave will run concurrently with
               PFML.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Substance Use Disorders:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The amended regulations expressly state that that a substance use
            disorder may be a serious health condition under the law. Family or medical leave may
            only be taken for treatment by a healthcare provider, a provider of healthcare services
            on referral by a healthcare provider, or a program licensed or approved by the
            Massachusetts Department of Public Health. An absence because of the employee's use of
            the substance, rather than for treatment, doesn't qualify for leave.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Applying for Benefits:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The amended regulations establish that an eligible individual may file
            an application for PFML benefits with the state no more than 60 calendar days before the
            anticipated start date of the leave. The amended regulations also allow the employer to
            submit an application for benefits on behalf of a covered individual, provided that the
            employer first: (1) receives approval from the state; and (2) agrees to adhere to all of
            the requirements for PFML applications, including timelines.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employee Notice:</span></p>

         <p class="p">An employee must generally give no less than 30 calendar days' notice to
            their employer of the anticipated start date of leave. If a delay in providing notice is
            beyond the employee's control, notice must be provided as soon as practical. Under the
            amended regulations, the state says it won't accept an application for benefits unless
            notice to the employer was made in accordance with the requirements.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Contract Workers:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Under the law, employers must count covered contract workers as part of
            their workforce. The amended regulations define a covered contract worker as a
            self-employed individual:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">For whom an employer is required to report payment for services on
               IRS Form 1099-MISC; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">For whom an employer or covered business entity is required to remit
               contributions to the Family and Employment Security Trust Fund pursuant to the
               requirements of the PFML law; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Who performs services as an individual in Massachusetts; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Who resides in Massachusetts; <span class="ph em">and</span></span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Who isn't classified as an independent contractor under state law.
            </span></li>

         </ul>
