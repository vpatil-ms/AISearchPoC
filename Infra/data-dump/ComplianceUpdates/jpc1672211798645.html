      <p class="p">The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has announced that it will enforce an emergency rule regarding vaccination of healthcare workers in 25 states and the District of Columbia.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jpc1672211798645__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2><p class="p">By way of background, CMS issued an emergency rule in early November that would require COVID-19 vaccination for workers at healthcare facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. However, preliminary injunctions issued in late November are blocking the implementation and enforcement of the emergency rule in 25 states. CMS is appealing those decisions, and the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on the preliminary injunctions on January 7, 2022.</p>
<p class="p">Previously, CMS said it wouldn't attempt to enforce the emergency rule in any state pending
            future developments in the litigation. However, on December 28, 2021, CMS issued <a class="xref" href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/qso-22-07-all.pdf" target="_blank">updated guidance</a> indicating that it plans to enforce the
            emergency rule in the jurisdictions where it isn't blocked by injunction. As a result,
            CMS will enforce the rule in the following states and the District of Columbia:</p>
<p class="p">California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">New Compliance Deadlines:</span></p>
<p class="p">The following compliance deadlines apply in the above jurisdictions:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">By January 27, 2022, all covered staff must have received the first dose of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccine or a one-dose COVID-19 vaccine or have a pending request for, or have been granted, a qualifying exemption; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">By February 28, 2022, all covered staff must have received the second dose of two-dose COVID-19 vaccine (if applicable) or have been granted a qualifying exemption. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Covered Facilities:</span></p>

<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Staff Coverage:</span></p>
<p class="p">The vaccination requirement applies to eligible staff working at a facility that participates in Medicare and Medicaid programs, regardless of clinical responsibility or patient contact. The requirement includes all current staff as well as any new staff who provide any care, treatment, or other services for the facility and/or its patients. This includes facility employees, licensed practitioners, students, trainees, volunteers, and individuals under contract or other arrangements.</p>

For employers in states and localities that prohibit or restrict vaccination or face covering requirements, discuss planning and preparation options with your internal or external employment counsel. Continue to watch for developments closely.</p>
