      <p class="p">New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the New York Health and Essential Rights Act, or <span class="q">“the NY HERO Act”</span> (the Act), into law on May 5, 2021. The Act adds workplace health and safety protections for airborne infectious diseases and requires employers to establish a health and safety plan.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jts1672211787004__section_N1004C_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Update March 2022:</h2><p class="p">The NY State Commissioner of Health has removed the COVID-19 designation from January 2022. Although employers are no longer required to implement a HERO Act disease prevention plan, based on the text of the law, they still must provide written notice of it to new hires; include a copy of it in employee handbooks and post a copy of it at each worksite in a visible, prominent location. They must also keep an airborne Infectious Disease Exposure Prevention Plan in place.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Update January 2022: </span>The New York State Commissioner
            of Health has extended the designation of COVID-19 as a highly contagious communicable
            disease that presents a serious risk of harm to the public. This means employers must
            continue to follow their HERO Act disease prevention plans until at least February 15,
            2022.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Update September 6, 2021: </span>Governor Kathy Hochul
            announced that the New York State Commissioner of Health has designated COVID-19 as a
            highly contagious communicable disease that presents a serious risk of harm to the
            public health, effectively requiring New York employers to implement their workplace
            health and safety plans.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Update July 2021:</span> Governor Andrew Cuomo signed
            Assembly Bill 7477, which, among other things, extends the deadline to August 5, 2021
            for employers to adopt a<a class="xref" href="https://dol.ny.gov/model-airborne-infectious-disease-exposure-prevention-plan" target="_blank">disease prevention plan</a>. Within 30 days of
            adopting a plan, employers must also provide written notification of the plan to
            employees. The NYDOL also posted its<a class="xref" href="https://dol.ny.gov/airborne-infectious-disease-exposure-prevention-standard" target="_blank">model standards</a>and will continue to update
