      <p class="p">Minnesota has enacted legislation (House File 782), which creates a state-run retirement program that workers in the private sector can join and requires participation by employers if they have five or more employees and don't offer a retirement plan. The law doesn't set a timeline for implementing the program. However, the program's board of directors must begin operation of the program no earlier than January 1, 2025.</p>

      <section class="section" id="vtw1688015817614__section_jjt_bl4_1yb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">House File 782 establishes the Minnesota Secure Choice program, a state-run payroll
            withholding savings program using Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).</p>

         <p class="p">The program doesn't require (or even allow) employers to contribute to the IRAs.
            However, unless exempt, employers are required to facilitate the program.</p>

         <p class="p">Minnesota employers must facilitate the Secure Choice program if they:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="vtw1688015817614__ul_akk_dl4_1yb">
            <li><span class="li">Employ five or more covered employees; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Don't sponsor or contribute to, and didn't in the immediately preceding 12 months,
               sponsor or contribute to a retirement savings plan for their employees. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <div class="note note" id="vtw1688015817614__note_bkk_dl4_1yb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employers that contract with employee leasing companies, professional employer
               organizations, or other similar entities to obtain workers are also covered under the
               program, unless that entity has a retirement savings plan that exempts it from the
               program.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p">To facilitate the program, covered employers must:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="vtw1688015817614__ul_ckk_dl4_1yb">
            <li><span class="li">Enroll employees in the program and withhold payroll deduction contributions from
               each covered employee's paycheck, unless the covered employee has elected not to
               contribute. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Timely remit contributions to the program. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide information about the program to employees at least 30 days prior to the
               date of the first paycheck from which employee contributions could be deducted for
               transmittal to the program, if the covered employee doesn't elect to opt out of the
               program. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The information to provide to employees and the timeline for implementing the program,
            including when enrollment and contributions must begin, will be developed by the
            program's board of directors.</p>

      <section class="section" id="vtw1688015817614__section_nww_bl4_1yb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Next Steps</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Employers are not required to take any immediate action at this time. The program's
            board of directors must first develop procedures to administer the program. We will
            continue to keep clients informed of any future developments.</p>
