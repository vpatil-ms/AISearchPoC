      <p class="p">New York Governor Kathy Hochul has announced via a press release the progress and added efforts by the Wage Theft Task Force to combat employer wage theft in New York.</p>

      <section class="section" id="nys1679044752123__section_o14_ttj_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The Wage Theft Task Force is a joint effort between the state's Department of Labor
            (DOL), attorney general and district attorneys.</p>

         <p class="p">The task force's efforts began in the construction industry, covering wage theft,
            failure to pay prevailing wages in public works contracts, fraud and safety hazards.
            Since then, the task force's mandate was expanded to other industries in New York, such
            as restaurant enterprises, focusing on wage theft, misclassification of employees and
            overtime pay.</p>

               updates in real-time. The project is scheduled to be completed in 2023. </span></li>
