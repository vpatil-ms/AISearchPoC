      <p class="p">Colorado has issued final rules addressing employer participation
         requirements and benefits under the state's paid family and medical leave insurance
         program. The final rules take effect on <span class="ph strong">October 15, 2022</span>.</p>

      <p class="p">Employers can also meet the legal requirements through a private plan, as opposed to the public, state-run plan. The rules on private plans have not been adopted at this time but in general a private plan must provide equal or greater benefits and protections than the public plan.</p>

      <p class="p">All employers will need to collect and remit premiums under the public program beginning January 1, 2023, even if the employer intends to meet the requirements through a private plan. However, employers will be eligible for a refund of these premiums if they have received approval by the state for a private plan with an effective date on or before January 1, 2024.</p>

      <p class="p"> The focus of this update is on the public plan option.</p>

      <section class="section" id="oew1679044754254__section_N1004C_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">By way of background, beginning January 1, 2024, eligible employees may
            receive up to 12 weeks of leave and wage-replacement benefits in a 12-month period for
            the following purposes:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="oew1679044754254__ul_bjz_bvk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">To care for their own serious health condition; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To care for a new child during the first year after the birth,
               adoption, or placement through foster care of that child; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To care for a family member with a serious health condition; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that a
               family member is on active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order
               to active duty) in the armed forces; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When the employee or their family member is a victim of domestic
               violence, stalking, or sexual assault. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <div class="note note" id="oew1679044754254__note_cjz_bvk_wwb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employees with a serious health condition related to pregnancy or
               childbirth complications may take up to an additional four weeks (16 weeks in
               total).</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p">Employees must make a reasonable effort to schedule leave to avoid
            unduly disrupting the employer's operations. When the need for leave is foreseeable, an
            employee must provide at least 30 days' notice to their employer. If the necessity for
            leave isn't foreseeable, the employee must provide the notice as soon as practical.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers must:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="oew1679044754254__ul_zm3_bvk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Post a <a class="xref" href="https://famli.colorado.gov/employers/famli-toolkit-for-employers" target="_blank">notice</a> on the program in the workplace;
               and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Notify employees about the program in writing at the time of hire
               and when they learn that an employee is experiencing an event that would trigger such
               leave. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Final Rules:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The final rules define various terms and clarify issues related to
            benefits and employer participation requirements. Here are some examples:</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employer Participation Requirements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The final rules require employers to register with the Division of
            Family and Medical Leave Insurance (DFMLI) via <span class="q">“MyFAMLI+ Employer”</span>
            by January 1, 2023, or when they become an employer, whichever occurs later.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers must submit wage reports to the DFMLI via <span class="q">“MyFAMLI+ Employer”</span> on the same quarterly schedule as they submit premiums. If an
            employer fails to submit timely wage reports, the DFMLI may assess a fine of up to $50
            per employee whose wages weren't reported.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employee Eligibility:</span></p>

         <p class="p">To be eligible for benefits, employees must earn $2,500 during their <span class="q">“base period.”</span> The final rules clarify that this $2,500 threshold
            can be met from any combination of employers, and it need not include their current
            employer.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Serious Health Condition:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The state will generally use the federal Family and Medical Leave Act's
            provisions regarding <span class="q">“serious health condition”</span> to determine
            whether an employee's or family member's condition qualifies.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Applying for Benefits:</span></p>

         <p class="p">To request benefits, the employee must apply to the DFMLI. Applications
            may be submitted up to 30 days prior to the benefit start date. The DFMLI will notify
            the employer of the application submission within five business days. If the need for
            leave is unforeseeable, applications may be submitted up to 30 days after the leave has
            begun.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employee Notice to Employer:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The final rules clarify that employee notice to the employer doesn't
            need to include any specific terms or reference specific provisions of the paid family
            and medical leave law or its implementing regulations, but the notice must reasonably
            implicate qualifying leave under the law. Employers may require the notice to contain
            the anticipated start time, anticipated duration, and where applicable, anticipated
            frequency of leave.</p>

         <p class="p">Notification must be in the same manner as the employee and employer
            typically communicate work availability, and absent unusual circumstances, must comply
            with the employer's usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for leave.
            Unless those requirements are contrary to rights, benefits, or protections afforded to
            the claimant under the law and its implementing regulations.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="oew1679044754254__note_N100D0_N1004C_N10039_N10001"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>If employers fail to post the required notice about the program, they
               are prohibited from taking adverse action against employees who fail to provide
               notice.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Rolling Twelve Months:</span></p>

         <p class="p">To determine the amount of leave an employee has available, a 12-month
            period that is measured backward from the date an employee uses paid family and medical
            leave benefits must be used. Under this ''rolling'' 12-month period, each time an
            employee takes paid family and medical leave, the remaining leave entitlement would be
            the balance that hasn't been used during the immediately preceding 12 months.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Fitness For Duty Certifications:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The final rules clarify that employers aren't prohibited from requiring
            an employee to provide certification of their fitness for duty prior to returning to
            work from paid family and medical leave, provided it isn't used to discriminate,
            retaliate, or interfere with the employee's rights.</p>
