      <p class="p">New York City enacted legislation (Int. No. 1894-A) that amends the New York City Human Rights Law and regulates the use of automated tools in certain employment decisions. The law was scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023.</p>

      <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Update December 2022:</span></p>

      <p class="p">The New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection has announced that it intends to postpone enforcement of the law until April 15, 2023, after a second public hearing occurs. The department has not released the date of the hearing.</p>

      <section class="section" id="gxe1679044760106__section_N10048_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2>
         <p class="p">The city previously issued <a class="xref" href="https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Notice-of-Adoption-Open-Captioning-Employment-Decision-Tools-Force-Fed-Prods.pdf" target="_blank">guidance</a> that contains the <a class="xref" href="https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Notice-of-Adoption-Open-Captioning-Employment-Decision-Tools-Force-Fed-Prods.pdf" target="_blank">schedule of penalties</a> employers may face if found in
            violation of the law, and lists circumstances under which a separate, daily violation
            would occur:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="gxe1679044760106__ul_cgy_wml_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">An employer's failure to provide notice to a candidate or employee as required by
               law. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Each day an employer uses an automated employment decision tool in violation of the
               law. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The legislation regulates New York City employers and employment agencies' use of
            artificial intelligence, data analytics, machine learning, or statistical modeling
            (automated employment decision tools) that are used to substantially assist or replace
            discretionary decision making for employment decisions.</p>

         <p class="p">The law generally applies to computerized tools or software programs based on algorithms
            to identify, select, evaluate or recruit candidates, such as:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="gxe1679044760106__ul_dgy_wml_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Recruiting tools that review résumés, chat with or rank applicants, or conduct
               behavioral analysis of candidates; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Tools used to assess workers' skills, performance and productivity, or monitor
               field-based or remote employees. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <div class="note note" id="gxe1679044760106__note_egy_wml_wwb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The law does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist
               or replace discretionary decision-making processes and that does not materially
               impact people, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall,
               antivirus software, calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation
               of data. The law is also silent on tools that identify employees for termination or
               reductions in force.</p>

      <section class="section" id="gxe1679044760106__section_gyn_1nl_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Notice Requirement:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Under the law, employers must notify a New York City resident that applied for a
            position (at least 10 business days before using the tool) if their application will be
            subject to an automated tool as part of the decision-making process and what specific
            job qualifications and characteristics the tool will use to assess workers and
            candidates. The notice must also inform candidates of their right to request an
            alternative selection process or accommodation.</p>

      <section class="section" id="gxe1679044760106__section_p2k_zml_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Using an Automated Employment Decision Tool:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">To use an automated employment decision tool, covered employers must retain an
            independent auditor to assess whether the tool's selection criteria result in disparate
            impact based on race, ethnicity, or sex on an annual basis. They must also publish a
            summary of the results and the distribution date of the tool on their website.</p>

         <p class="p">The law also requires covered employers to retain information about the source and type
            of data collected for the tool and the businesses' data retention policy. Employers must
            disclose this information on their website or provide it to an applicant within 30 days
            of a written request, unless prohibited by law.</p>

      <section class="section" id="gxe1679044760106__section_r4k_pml_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Next Steps:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Monitor the postponed enforcement of the law. If it takes effect<span class="ph strong"> April 15, 2023</span>, after a second public hearing occurs, and
            if considering the use of automated employment decision tools, New York City employers
            should:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="gxe1679044760106__ul_pjx_pml_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Create a process for conducting independent audits as required by law; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Comply with the notice requirements above and consider issuing the required notice
               to all applicants for New York City openings and promotions to help minimize issues
               with capturing NYC residency; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Allow for employees and candidates to opt-out of the automated employment tool
               process; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Update data-retention policies to ensure compliance with the law. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Covered employers should also anticipate further regulations from the city that clarify
            their obligations under the law.</p>
