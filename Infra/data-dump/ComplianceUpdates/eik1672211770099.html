      <p class="p">The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has published a final rule that amends and
         clarifies the test for determining whether a joint-employer relationship exists for
         purposes of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The final rule takes effect <span class="ph strong">April 27, 2020</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="eik1672211770099__section_N1004D_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The NLRA provides certain rights and responsibilities that apply to employers, employees, and labor organizations representing employees. For instance, the NLRA gives employees the right to work together to improve wages, benefits, and working conditions, to join unions, and to file unfair labor practice complaints when they believe their employer violated the law.</p>
<p class="p">Under the NLRA, the determination of whether two entities are joint employers is important because both may be required to bargain with the union that represents the jointly employed employees, both may be potentially liable for unfair labor practices committed by the other, and both may be subject to economic pressure if there is a labor dispute. During the Obama administration, the NLRB adopted a broader definition of joint employment.</p>

      <section class="section" id="eik1672211770099__section_N1005A_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Final Joint-Employer Rule:</h2><p class="p">Under the new rule, a business is a joint employer of another employer's employees <span class="ph em">only if</span> the two employers share or codetermine the employees'
            essential terms and conditions of employment. To be a joint employer, a business must
            possess and exercise such <span class="ph em">substantial direct and immediate
               control</span> over one or more essential terms and conditions of employment of another
            employer's employees as would warrant a finding that the business <span class="ph em">meaningfully affects matters</span> relating to the employment relationship.</p>
<p class="p">The final rule defines <span class="q">“essential terms and conditions of employment”</span> as wages, benefits, hours of work, hiring, discharge, discipline, supervision, and direction. Under the rule, <span class="q">“direct and immediate control”</span> means the following with respect to each term or condition:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Wages.</span> An entity exercises direct and immediate
               control over wages if it actually determines the wage rates, salary or other rate of
               pay that is paid to another employer's individual employees or job classifications.
               An entity doesn't exercise direct and immediate control over wages by entering into a
               cost-plus contract (with or without a maximum reimbursable wage rate). </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Benefits.</span> An entity exercises direct and immediate
               control over benefits if it actually determines the fringe benefits to be provided or
               offered to another employer's employees. This would include selecting the benefit
               plans (such as health insurance plans and pension plans) and/or level of benefits
               provided to another employer's employees. An entity doesn't exercise direct and
               immediate control over benefits by permitting another employer, under an arm's-length
               contract, to participate in its benefit plans. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Hours of work.</span> An entity exercises direct and
               immediate control over hours of work if it actually determines work schedules or the
               work hours, including overtime, of another employer's employees. An entity doesn't
               exercise direct and immediate control over hours of work by establishing an
               enterprise's operating hours or when it needs the services provided by another
               employer. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Hiring.</span> An entity exercises direct and immediate
               control over hiring if it actually determines which particular employees will be
               hired and which employees will not. An entity doesn't exercise direct and immediate
               control over hiring by requesting changes in staffing levels to accomplish tasks or
               by setting minimal hiring standards such as those required by government regulation. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Discipline and discharge.</span> An entity exercises direct
               and immediate control over discharge if it actually decides to terminate, suspend, or
               otherwise discipline another employer's employee. An entity doesn't exercise direct
               and immediate control over discharge or discipline by bringing misconduct or poor
               performance to the attention of another employer that makes the actual decision, by
               expressing a negative opinion of another employer's employee, by refusing to allow
               another employer's employee to continue performing work under a contract, or by
               setting minimal standards of performance or conduct, such as those required by
               government regulation. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Supervision.</span> An entity exercises direct and immediate
               control over supervision by actually instructing another employer's employees how to
               perform their work or by actually issuing employee performance appraisals. An entity
               doesn't exercise direct and immediate control over supervision when its instructions
               are limited and routine and consist primarily of telling another employer's employees
               what work to perform, or where and when to perform the work, but not how to perform
               it. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Direction.</span> An entity exercises direct and immediate
               control over direction by assigning particular employees their individual work
               schedules, positions, and tasks. An entity doesn't exercise direct and immediate
               control over direction by setting schedules for completion of a project or by
               describing the work to be accomplished on a project. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The final rule defines <span class="q">“substantial direct and immediate control”</span> as having a regular or
            continuous consequential effect on an essential term or condition of employment of
            another employer's employees. Such control is not <span class="q">“substantial”</span> if it is only
            exercised on a sporadic, isolated, or <span class="ph em">de minimis</span> basis.</p>
<p class="p">The final rule recognizes that evidence of indirect control and contractually reserved but never exercised control over essential terms and conditions may demonstrate joint-employer status, but only to the extent that it supplements and reinforces evidence of direct and immediate control.</p>

Keep in mind that the final rule only applies to the NLRA. There are different tests used for other federal laws and many states have their own tests for joint employment.</p>
