      <p class="p">New York has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 17A) that allows employees to petition their employer to participate in a shared work program in certain job loss instances. Senate Bill 17A is effective immediately.</p>

      <section class="section" id="qsp1672211796976__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The New York <a class="xref" href="https://dol.ny.gov/shared-work-program-0#:~:text=The%20Shared%20Work%20Program%20helps%2cand%20seasonal%20employees%20are%20eligible." target="_blank">Shared Work Program</a> is a job training program that provides employers with two or more employees an alternative to laying off workers during business downturns. Under the program, instead of experiencing layoffs, trained full-time, part-time, and seasonal employees may work a reduced work schedule and collect partial Unemployment Insurance benefits.</p>

      <section class="section" id="qsp1672211796976__section_N10059_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Senate Bill 17A:</h2><p class="p">Under Senate Bill 17A, employees may petition an employer to apply to participate in the Shared Work Program. Employees may petition their employer, in writing, when they reasonably expect to, or have experienced, an employment loss due to a reduction in the workforce, and they are trying to either avoid the layoffs or have previously laid-off employees rehired.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employer Response:</span></p>
<p class="p">Covered employers are required to respond, in writing, to an employee petition that calls for them to join a shared work program no later than seven days after the making of the petition. When responding to the petition, employers must provide, in writing, a response that states:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Whether they will apply to participate in a shared work program; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The reason for their decision; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If the employer decided to apply, the outcome of the application, if available. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Retaliation Prohibited:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers, their agents, or persons acting as or on behalf of a hiring entity, or the officer or agent of any corporation, partnership, or limited liability company, are prohibited from discriminating, retaliating against, or taking adverse action against an employee that exercises their rights under the law.</p>
