      <p class="p">Alabama has published emergency regulations addressing a state law that prohibits employers from requiring employees to receive COVID-19 vaccination without providing the employee an opportunity to seek an exemption for religious or medical reasons. The state has also published a sample exemption request form, which is available <a class="xref" href="https://vaxexemption.alabama.gov/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <p class="p">The <a class="xref" href="http://www.alabamaadministrativecode.state.al.us/ER/ER-NOV-21/LAB%20480-9-1%20ER.pdf" target="_blank">emergency regulations</a> address Senate Bill 9, which was enacted
         in November 2021 and states that employers must provide an exemption from COVID-19
         vaccination requirements to any employee who has properly completed and submitted an
         exemption form.</p>

      <section class="section" id="vyf1672211797505__section_N1005A_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Evaluating a Request:</h2><p class="p">When evaluating an employee's exemption request, the employer must liberally construe the employee's eligibility for an exemption in favor of the employee, consistent with applicable law.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="vyf1672211797505__section_N10064_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Denying a Request:</h2><p class="p">The regulations state that in the event an employer denies a request for exemption, the employer must provide the employee with instructions on how to file a request for review by an administrative law judge.</p>
<p class="p">Under the regulations, employees must submit the requests for review via <a class="xref" href="https://vaxexemption.alabama.gov/" target="_blank">https://vaxexemption.alabama.gov/</a> and include a copy of the denied exemption
            request form, a valid email address for the employee and the employer, and any other
            documentation the employee wishes to be considered. The employer will have three
            business days to provide any pertinent information to the administrative law judge for
            consideration regarding the employee's exemption claim. A poster with instructions for
            requesting an exemption and review is available <a class="xref" href="https://vaxexemption.alabama.gov/Data/Poster.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<div class="note note" id="vyf1672211797505__note_N1007E_N10064_N10041_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>An employer who has denied an employee's exemption request is prohibited from terminating the employee on the basis of failing to receive a vaccination for a period of 7 calendar days after the denial was issued by the employer, or if the employee is a review of the decision, until the judge or court issues a final ruling in the employer's favor. During this period, the employer must compensate the employee at the same rate of pay the employee received prior to submitting an exemption form.</p>
