      <p class="p">The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is requiring the use of face masks indoors for the next four weeks, regardless of the individual's COVID-19 vaccination status.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2><p class="p">The CDPH says individuals must wear masks in indoor public settings from December 15, 2021 through January 15, 2022, regardless of whether they are vaccinated. The requirement applies to all workplaces, regardless of whether they serve the public, or are open to the public, according to the CDPH. The CDPH recommends surgical masks or higher-level respirators.</p>
<div class="note note"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>For local health jurisdictions that had preexisting mask requirements irrespective of vaccine status for indoor public settings, prior to December 13, 2021, those local health orders continue to apply.</p>
