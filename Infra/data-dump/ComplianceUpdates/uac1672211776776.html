      <p class="p">A federal district court judge in New York has struck down regulations relating to joint employment under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).</p>

      <section class="section" id="uac1672211776776__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Among other things, the FLSA requires employers to pay non-exempt
            employees at least the minimum wage for each hour worked and overtime when they work
            more than 40 hours in a workweek. Under the FLSA, more than one employer may be
            responsible for FLSA violations when a joint-employer relationship exists.</p>

         <p class="p">There are generally two different types of joint employment:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Scenario 1:</span> The employee has an
               employer who employs them to work, but another entity simultaneously benefits from
               that work. For example, the employer could be a subcontractor, and the potential
               joint employer is the general contractor. Or a joint employer relationship might
               exist where a business uses a contractor for cleaning services. This is also known as
               vertical joint employment.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Scenario 2:</span> One employer employs an
               employee for one set of hours in a workweek, and another employer employs the same
               employee for a separate set of hours in the same workweek, but the jobs and the hours
               worked for each employer are separate. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Final Rule:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a final rule that
            primarily addressed vertical joint employment (Scenario 1 above). Under the final rule,
            joint employment exists in Scenario 1 where the other entity is acting directly or
            indirectly in the interest of the employer in relation to the employee. To apply this
            standard, the final rule established a four-part test that looks at whether the
            potential joint employer:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Hires or fires the employee; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Supervises and controls the employee's work schedules or conditions
               of employment to a substantial degree; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Determines the employee's rate and method of payment; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Maintains the employee's employment records. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Shortly after the final rule was issued, a group of states filed a
            lawsuit challenging it.</p>

      <section class="section" id="uac1672211776776__section_N1007C_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">New York District Court's Ruling:</h2><p class="p">On September 8, 2020, a federal judge for the Southern District of New York struck down the final rule's interpretation of vertical joint employment, finding that it conflicts with the FLSA and is arbitrary and impermissibly narrow. The court said that while the four factors the DOL adopted for the test can be relevant to the determination of joint employment, the DOL went too far in requiring that an entity satisfy one or more of those factors in order to be considered a joint employer. The court also criticized the DOL's final rule for excluding economic dependence as irrelevant to joint employer status, finding that it contradicts caselaw and the DOL's own views.</p>

      <section class="section" id="uac1672211776776__section_N10086_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">The judge's ruling creates confusion about how to determine whether joint employment exists. For instance, it's unclear whether the ruling applies to just employers in the Southern District of New York (the counties of New York, Bronx, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Dutchess, and Sullivan) or employers nationally. The ruling itself doesn't address this issue, and the DOL hasn't responded to the ruling yet. All employers should monitor the situation closely and discuss the implications of the ruling with their legal counsel.</p>
