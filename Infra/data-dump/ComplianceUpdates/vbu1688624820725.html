      <p class="p">It was previously reported that on June 12, 2023, the New York City Department of Consumer
         and Worker Protection (DCWP) released the <a class="xref" href="https://rules.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DCWP-NOA-Minimum-Pay-for-Food-Delivery-Workers.pdf" target="_blank">final rule</a> regarding the required minimum wage for app-based
         restaurant delivery workers. <a class="xref" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dca/workers/workersrights/Delivery-Workers.page#:~:text=Minimum%20Pay&amp;text=Apps%20that%20pay%20for%20all%2cper%20minute%2C%20not%20including%20tips" target="_blank">New York City has announced</a> that the minimum wage rate
         requirements for delivery workers of third-party food delivery services scheduled to take
         effect on July 12, 2023 have now been postponed due to pending lawsuits.</p>

      <section class="section" id="vbu1688624820725__section_N1004E_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Prior to the final rule, there were no minimum pay protections for app-based food
            delivery workers who work for a third-party delivery service as independent
            contractors.</p>

         <p class="p">Now, beginning with the first pay period on or after July 12, 2023, app-based restaurant
            delivery workers must be paid a minimum wage as follows:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Apps that pay for all the time a worker is connected to the app (i.e., time waiting
               for trip offers and trip time) must pay at least $17.96 per hour, which is
               approximately $0.30* per minute, not including tips. This rate will increase to
               $18.96 on April 1, 2024, and $19.96 on April 1, 2025, plus an adjustment for
               inflation each year;</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">or</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Apps that only pay for trip time (i.e., time from accepting a delivery offer to
               dropping off the delivery) must pay at least approximately $0.50* per minute, not
               including tips. This rate will reach approximately $0.53* per minute on April 1,
               2024, and $0.55* per minute on April 1, 2025, plus an adjustment for inflation each
               year.</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">* According to the DCWP, due to rounding, these rates are approximate. Apps must
            calculate exact pay in accordance with DCWP Rule.</p>

         <p class="p">Important definitions regarding the final rule are as follows:</p>

         <p class="p">Food delivery worker. A <span class="q">“food delivery worker”</span> is someone who is hired, retained,
            or engaged as an independent contractor by a licensed third-party food delivery service
            or a third-party courier service to deliver food, beverage, or other goods from a
            business to a consumer in exchange for compensation.</p>

         <p class="p">Food service establishment. A <span class="q">“food service establishment”</span> is a business
            establishment located within the city where food is provided for individual portion
            service directly to the consumer whether such food is provided free of charge or sold,
            and whether consumption occurs on or off the premises or is provided from a pushcart,
            stand or vehicle.</p>

         <p class="p">Third-party courier service. A <span class="q">“third-party courier service”</span> means a service that
            (i) facilitates the same-day delivery or same-day pickup of food, beverages, or other
            goods from a food service establishment on behalf of such food service establishment or
            a third-party food delivery service; (ii) that is owned and operated by a person other
            than the person who owns such food service establishment; and (iii) and is not a
            third-party food delivery service.</p>

         <p class="p">Third-party food delivery service. A <span class="q">“third-party food delivery service”</span> is any
            website, mobile application, or other internet service that: (i) offers or arranges for
            the sale of food and beverages prepared by, and the same-day delivery or same-day pickup
            of food and beverages from, a food service establishment; and (ii) that is owned and
            operated by a person other than the person who owns such food service establishment.</p>

         <p class="p">Trip. A <span class="q">“trip”</span> is the time spent, distance travelled, and route followed by a
            worker to provide delivery services to a consumer through a third-party food delivery
            service or third-party courier service, including travel to a business, picking up the
            food, beverage, or other goods for delivery, and taking and depositing such delivery at
            a different location as requested.</p>

         <p class="p">Effective the first pay period beginning on or after July 12, 2023, businesses
            contracting with app-based restaurant delivery workers as independent contractors must
            pay at least a minimum wage as outlined above. Businesses impacted by the DCWP final
            rule should consult with their legal or accounting advisors to ensure compliance.</p>
