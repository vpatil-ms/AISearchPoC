      <p class="p">New Jersey has enacted legislation (Senate Bill S2380) that adds benefit protections for
         essential workers. The law is retroactive to March 9, 2020, and extends for the duration of
         the public health emergency declared under <a class="xref" href="https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-103.pdf" target="_blank">Executive
            Order 103</a>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="zdr1672211779225__section_N1004F_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Overview:</h2><p class="p">Essential workers who test positive for COVID-19 during the public health emergency are presumed to have contracted the virus at work. This means that covered workers would be entitled to workers' compensation, ordinary and accidental disability retirement, and any other benefits required by law to individuals suffering injury or illness during their employment.</p>

Workers' compensation claims paid under these circumstances will not affect the insurance premium rate for the employer's workers' compensation policy.</p>
