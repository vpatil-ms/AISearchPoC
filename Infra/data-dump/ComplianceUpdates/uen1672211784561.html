      <p class="p">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas has ruled that employers are prohibited from discriminating against LGBTQ workers under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA).</p>

      <section class="section" id="uen1672211784561__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The <a class="xref" href="https://hhs.texas.gov/laws-regulations/handbooks/smccsp/chapter-1-basic-standards/1-3-3-article-5221k-texas-commission-human-rights-act-1983#:~:text=The%20Texas%20Commission%20on%20Human%2corigin%2C%20disability%2C%20and%20age.&amp;text=The%20EEOC%20empowers%20TCHR%20to%20investigate%20and%20conciliate%20complaints%20of%20employment%20discrimination" target="_blank">TCHRA</a> prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, among other protected characteristics, but previously did not expressly protect workers who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, or Queer (LGBTQ) based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>
<p class="p">In June of 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of <a class="xref" href="https://www.hrc.org/news/what-the-supreme-court-ruling-in-bostock-means-for-state-legislative-effort" target="_blank">Bostock v. Clayton County</a> that the protected characteristic, <span class="q">“sex,”</span> includes an individual's sexual orientation and gender identity. This ruling added protections for LGBTQ workers from employment discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity under Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act.</p>

Sims</a>, Amanda Sims alleged
            that her employer, Tarrant County College District, discriminated against her due to her
            sexual orientation. On March 10, 2021, a Texas Appeals Court sided with the U.S. Supreme
            Court's opinion in <cite class="cite">Bostock v. Clayton County</cite>. The Court indicated that one
            of the general purposes of the TCHRA is to <span class="q">“provide for the execution of the policies
               of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its subsequent amendments.”</span> The
            ruling means that discrimination against employees on the basis of their sexual
            orientation and gender identity is a form of sex discrimination and is not permitted
            under the TCHRA.</p>
