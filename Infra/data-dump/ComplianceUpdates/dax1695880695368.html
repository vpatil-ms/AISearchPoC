      <p class="p">With the enactment of <a class="xref" href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2024/Docs/ACTS/ACT076/ACT076%20As%20Enacted.pdf" target="_blank">HB 217</a>, Vermont created a new payroll tax to fund its Child Assistance Program, which subsidizes child care costs for certain families.</p>

         <p class="p">Effective July 1, 2024, the payroll tax will be 0.44% of an employee's covered wages.
            Covered wages consist of all wages and benefits that are subject to federal income tax
            withholding.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="q">“Covered employers”</span> are required to pay a minimum amount equal to 75% of the
            required 0.44% payroll tax for each <span class="q">“covered employee.”</span></p>

         <p class="p">Covered employers are defined as a person or entity who employs one or more covered
            employees and is required to withhold Vermont income tax from wages paid to their
            employees.</p>

         <p class="p">Covered employees are defined as individuals who receive payments with respect to
            services performed for an employer from which the employer is required to withhold
            Vermont income tax.</p>

         <p class="p">Under HB 217, employers are allowed to deduct 25% of the tax, or 0.11% from employee's
            wages. <span class="ph em">If employees are under withheld, the employers is
               responsible for the full amount of any unpaid employee contributions.</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers are required to remit the employee and employer contributions to the Vermont
            Department of Taxes (VDOT), in the same manner as employees income tax withholding.</p>

         <p class="p">Self-employed individuals are required to pay 0.11% of their self-employment income and
            remit to the VDOT at the same time and in the same manner as their estimated Vermont
            withholding income tax.</p>

         <p class="p">Effective July 1, 2024, Vermont covered employers must remit to the VDOT 0.44% of
            covered employees wages to the <span class="q">“Child Care Contribution Fund.”</span> Employers have the
            option to withhold 0.11% of employees wages to offset the employers 0.44% obligation.
            The employer is responsible for remitting the entire 0.44% required.</p>
