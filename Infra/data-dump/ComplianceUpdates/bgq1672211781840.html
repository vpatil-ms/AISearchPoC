      <p class="p">The city of San Jose (CA) has adopted an emergency ordinance that extends
         and expands a requirement for employers to provide paid sick leave to employees for reasons
         related to COVID-19. The ordinance is in effect through <span class="ph strong">June 30,
            2021</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="bgq1672211781840__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">On April 7, 2020, San Jose adopted an ordinance that required employers to provide paid sick leave to employees if they were exempt from the leave requirements under the federal <a class="xref" href="https://sbshrs.adpinfo.com/covid19-stimulus-package" target="_blank">Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)</a>. The FFCRA only applied to employers with fewer than 500 employees and included certain other exemptions. The city's ordinance was meant to address the gaps in the FFCRA and was set to expire on December 31, 2020.</p>

      <section class="section" id="bgq1672211781840__section_N10059_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">New San Jose Emergency Ordinance:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Because the FFCRA's leave requirements expired on December 31, 2020, the
            city adopted a new emergency ordinance that: (1) extends the paid sick leave
            requirements through June 30, 2021; and (2) expands the ordinance to cover <span class="ph em">all employers</span> that meet both of the following criteria:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employer is subject to the Business License Tax required by the
               city or maintains a facility within the boundaries of the city. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employer is lawfully allowed to conduct business activities
               under the County of Santa Clara, state or federal health orders. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The new ordinance took effect retroactively on January 1, 2021.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Covered Employees:</span></p>

         <p class="p">To be eligible for the leave under the ordinance, the employee must:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Work at least two hours within the geographic boundaries of the city
               for a covered employer; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Leave their own residence to perform work for the employer and is
               unable to telecommute. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Amount of Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Under the ordinance, a full-time employee is entitled to 80 hours of
            paid sick leave. A part-time employee is entitled to sick leave hours equal to the
            number of hours they work on average over a two-week period.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="bgq1672211781840__note_N10087_N10059_N10041_N10001"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The new ordinance didn't increase the total amount of paid sick leave
               that employers must provide, Therefore, under the ordinance, eligible employees are
               entitled to up to a total of 80 hours of paid sick leave for the entire period from
               April 2, 2020 through June 30, 2021.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Use:</span></p>

         <p class="p">An employee may use paid sick leave for any of the following
            purposes:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employee is subject to quarantine or isolation by federal, state
               or local order due to COVID-19, or is caring for someone who is quarantined or
               isolated due to COVID-19; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee is advised by a healthcare provider to self-quarantine
               due to COVID-19 or is caring for someone who is so advised by a healthcare provider; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee experiences symptoms of COVID-19 and is seeking medical
               diagnosis; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee is caring for a minor child because a school or daycare
               is closed due to COVID-19. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The employee can take paid sick leave for one or more of the above
            qualifying reasons until the employee either: (1) uses the full amount of paid sick
            leave; or (2) no longer has a qualifying reason for taking paid sick leave.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Pay During Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">During the leave, the employee is entitled to be paid their regular rate
            of pay, up to $511 per day (and a total of $5,110). However, leave to care for an
            individual on quarantine/isolation/self-quarantine or to care for a child whose school
            or daycare is closed may be compensated at 2/3 of the employee's regular rate of pay, up
            to a maximum of $200 per day (and a total of $2,000).</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Exception:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The ordinance doesn't apply to any employer that provides its employees,
            on the effective date of the ordinance, with some combination of paid personal leave at
            least equivalent to the paid sick leave required by the ordinance.</p>
