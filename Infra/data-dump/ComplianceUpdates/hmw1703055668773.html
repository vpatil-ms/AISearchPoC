      <p class="p">New York has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 4516) that further limits the terms employers may include in release agreements related to discrimination, harassment and retaliation. Senate Bill 4516 is effective immediately and applies to agreements entered into on or after November 17, 2023.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Background</p>
<p class="p"><a class="xref" href="https://casetext.com/statute/consolidated-laws-of-new-york/chapter-general-obligations/article-5-creation-definition-and-enforcement-of-contractual-obligations/title-3-certain-prohibited-contracts-and-provisions-of-contracts/section-5-336-nondisclosure-agreements" target="_blank">New York General Obligations Law Section 5-336</a> prohibits an
            employer from requiring confidentiality provisions in agreements to resolve unlawful
            discrimination claims, unless requested by an employee.</p>
<p class="p">A release agreement that has a confidentiality provision covering discrimination or sexual
            harassment claims must be executed in <a class="xref" href="https://www.ny.gov/combating-sexual-harassment-workplace/combating-sexual-harassment-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">two parts</a>. The agreement must state it is the employee's
            preference to enter the agreement; and the employee has 21 days to consider the
            agreement and 7 days to revoke their consent after the expiration of the 21-day
            period.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Senate Bill 4516</p>

         <p class="p">Senate Bill 4516 amends Section 5-336 to:</p>

            <li><span class="li">Expand protections under the law, previously only granted to employees and potential
               employees, to now include independent contractors; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Allow employees to accept the terms of a release agreement containing a
               confidentiality provision prior to the expiration of the 21-day period, instead of
               the previous law that required the 21 days to pass before the employee could sign any
               such agreement; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Render some agreements unenforceable if release of a covered claim requires that the
               complainant: <ul class="ul" id="hmw1703055668773__ul_zhr_xyg_vzb">
                  <li><span class="li">Pay certain damages for violation of a non-disclosure or nondisparagement
                     clause; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Forfeit all (or part of) the consideration for the agreement for violation of
                     a non-disclosure or nondisparagement clause; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Make an affirmative statement, assertion or disclaimer that they were not
                     subject to unlawful discrimination (including discriminatory harassment or
                     retaliation). </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Add further restrictions to confidentiality agreements related to harassment,
               discrimination and retaliation. </span></li>
