      <p class="p">Colorado's public health emergency leave requirement applies to not just COVID-19, but also the flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and similar respiratory illnesses, according to guidance issued by the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE). The change is a result of the inclusion of those conditions in <a class="xref" href="https://www.colorado.gov/governor/sites/default/files/inline-files/D%202022%20044%20Colorado%20COVID-19%20and%20Other%20Respiratory%20Illnesses%20Disaster%20Recovery%20Order%20Amendment%20EO.pdf" target="_blank">Colorado's latest public health emergency (PHE) declaration</a> as of November 11, 2022.</p>

      <section class="section" id="vnx1679044758964__section_njc_q4l_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">By way of background, all employers in Colorado must provide up to 80 hours of public
            health emergency leave (PHEL). In addition to PHEL covering COVID-19 related absences,
            the CDLE has confirmed PHEL covers both RSV and the flu as well. The expansion beyond
            COVID-19 doesn't give employees an extra 80 hours for those conditions. It just means
            they can use their 80 hours for a broader range of conditions.</p>

         <p class="p">According to the CDLE, employees may use PHEL for a range of PHE-related needs, not just
            for confirmed cases. These needs include:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="vnx1679044758964__ul_kdy_r4l_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Symptoms of COVID, flu, RSV or other similar respiratory illnesses. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Quarantining or isolating due to exposure. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Testing for COVID or similar respiratory illnesses. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Vaccination and its side effects. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Inability to work due to health conditions that may increase susceptibility or risk
               of COVID, flu, RSV or similar respiratory illnesses. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Needs to care for family (illness, school closure, etc.). </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Employers <span class="ph em">cannot</span> require documentation from
            employees to show that leave is for PHE-related needs, according to the CDLE
            guidance.</p>

         <p class="p">The 80-hour PHEL requirement will continue until four weeks after all applicable PHE
            declarations end or are suspended. Based on current emergency declarations, the PHEL
            requirement will continue at least into February 2023, and may extend longer if either
            the federal or the state PHE declaration is renewed further into 2023.</p>
