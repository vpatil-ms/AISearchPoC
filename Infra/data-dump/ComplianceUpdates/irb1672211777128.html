      <p class="p">Hawaii has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 2638) that amends the rules
         governing certification of the need for domestic violence leave and reasonable
         accommodations. Senate Bill 2638 takes effect <span class="ph strong">January 1,
         2021</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="irb1672211777128__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Hawaii Rev. Stat. § 378-72:</span></p>
<p class="p">Hawaii Rev. Stat. § 378-72 requires employers to provide unpaid leave to employees if they or their minor child have been a victim of domestic violence or sexual violence. Employers with 50 or more employees must allow employees to take up to 30 days of such leave per calendar year. Employers with fewer than 50 employees must allow employees to take up to five days per calendar year.</p>
<p class="p">Employees may use this leave to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Seek medical attention for themselves or their minor child to recover from physical or psychological injury or disability; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Obtain services from a victim services organization; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Obtain psychological or other counseling; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Temporarily or permanently relocate; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Take legal action or other actions to enhance the physical, psychological, or economic health or safety of the employee or their minor child or to enhance the safety of those who associate with or work with the employee. </span></li>

      </ul>
<p class="p">The statute also includes rules governing certification of an individual's need for such leave.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Hawaii Rev. Stat. § 378-81:</span></p>
<p class="p">Hawaii Rev. Stat. § 378-81 generally requires employers to provide a reasonable accommodation to employees who are victims of domestic or sexual violence, such as:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Changing the employee's contact information, such as telephone numbers, fax numbers, or email addresses; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Screening the employee's telephone calls; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Restructuring the employee's job functions; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Changing the employee's work location; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Installing locks and other security devices; and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Allowing the employee to work flexible hours. </span></li>

      <section class="section" id="irb1672211777128__section_N10093_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Senate Bill 2638:</h2><p class="p">Under Senate Bill 2638, if the employee: (1) has taken more than five calendar days of leave for non-medical reasons under Hawaii Rev. Stat. § 378-72; or (2) requests a reasonable accommodation under Hawaii Rev. Stat. § 378-81, then the employer may ask the employee to provide certification/verification in one of the following forms:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Certified or exemplified restraining orders, injunctions against harassment, and documents from criminal cases; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Documentation from a victim services organization or domestic or sexual violence program, agency, or facility, including a shelter or safe house for victims of domestic or sexual violence; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Documentation from a medical professional, mental healthcare provider, attorney, advocate, social worker, or member of the clergy from whom the employee or their minor child has sought assistance in relation to the domestic or sexual violence. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">For the purposes of reasonable accommodations, employers may request verification no more than once every six months. However, if the employee provides a protective order with an expiration date, the employer is prohibited from requesting any further verification until the date of the expiration or any extensions of the protective order, whichever is later.</p>
