      <p class="p">The Treasury Department and Small Business Administration (SBA) have released a simplified Payroll Protection Program (PPP) forgiveness application (<a class="xref" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__link.edgepilot.com_s_ce74d35f_Y55jXOLbNUusgh-2DsZCp1ng-3Fu-3Dhttps-3A__www.sba.gov_sites_default_files_2020-2D10_PPP-252520Loan-252520Forgiveness-252520Application-252520Form-2525203508S.pdf&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=xu_5lAfKHjInGFR3ndoZrw&amp;r=0OhVyfNYh54JKEQKX4N4J9rtpuvWUnTsVP94cj2tvaM&amp;m=G1vL7KRgPQgIGaFc7AAZ6Sy7vlrEwMqFBXBFGM72gVo&amp;s=U7LIWLVb01QCCJ1nmnafkwldW1Nocc6G3ARiIf2xQZ8&amp;e=" target="_blank">Form 3508S</a>) and <a class="xref" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__link.edgepilot.com_s_4d76fdd5_rBaEYScyiU-5FeMLINY-2Du29Q-3Fu-3Dhttps-3A__www.sba.gov_sites_default_files_2020-2D10_PPP-252520Loan-252520Forgiveness-252520Application-252520Form-2525203508S-252520Instructions.pdf&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=xu_5lAfKHjInGFR3ndoZrw&amp;r=0OhVyfNYh54JKEQKX4N4J9rtpuvWUnTsVP94cj2tvaM&amp;m=G1vL7KRgPQgIGaFc7AAZ6Sy7vlrEwMqFBXBFGM72gVo&amp;s=_OVxQXQZWDbVuC0QA_jKloL7pK-gJqy-YpfksgTCSNc&amp;e=" target="_blank">instructions</a> for PPP loans of $50,000 or less.</p>

      <p class="p">The SBA adopted a <span class="ph em">de minimis</span> exemption from
         reductions in loan forgiveness (i.e., penalties) for failure to maintain the number of
         full-time-equivalent employees (FTEs), as well as wage level maintenance requirements, for
         PPP loans of $50,000 or less.</p>

      <p class="p">Borrowers with affiliates that collectively received PPP loans of $2 million or more cannot use the new form or new exemptions.</p>

      <section class="section" id="pez1672211779487__section_N1005E_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The PPP was enacted as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act to provide employers with funds to continue operations and payment of wages during the COVID-19 pandemic. These loans can be <a class="xref" href="https://www.adp.com/contact-us/customer-service/paycheck-protection-program.aspx" target="_blank">fully forgiven</a> if certain conditions are met, including at least 60 percent of the loan being used to cover payroll expenses. Borrowers must also maintain specific staffing and pay levels.</p>

      <section class="section" id="pez1672211779487__section_N1006F_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Forgiveness Reduction Waived for Smaller Loans:</h2><p class="p">The interim final rule issued by the SBA says that qualifying PPP borrowers won't need to document compliance with the targeted staffing and wage-level maintenance requirements. Loan forgiveness amounts won't be reduced, even if employee counts or wage levels decreased during or after the covered period, as long as the loan was $50,000 or less, and the borrower, when combined with any affiliates, collectively received less than $2 million.</p>

      <section class="section" id="pez1672211779487__section_N10079_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Future Legislation Possible:</h2><p class="p">There are several legislative proposals in Congress to further expand, simplify and extend the PPP program, including proposals that could authorize a second PPP loan for qualifying businesses. ADP will continue to closely monitor federal legislation and guidance affecting PPP loans.</p>

      <section class="section" id="pez1672211779487__section_N10083_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">Many borrowers may be ready to submit their forgiveness applications (SBA Form 3508, 3508EZ or
            3508S). The SBA began approving PPP forgiveness applications and remitting forgiveness
            payments to PPP lenders for PPP borrowers on October 2, 2020. Borrowers should check
            with their lenders directly to determine if they are prepared to accept forgiveness
            applications. For FAQs from the SBA, click <a class="xref" href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Paycheck-Protection-Program-Frequently-Asked-Questions.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
