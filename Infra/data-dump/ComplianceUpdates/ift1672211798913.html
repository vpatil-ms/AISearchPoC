      <p class="p">The Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Division has amended its rule (OAR 437-001-0744), which covers requirements for masks, physical distancing, and cleaning to combat COVID-19. The amended rule went into effect December 21, 2021.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ift1672211798913__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Cleaning Protocols:</span></p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Previous Rule:</span> Employers were required to regularly
            clean and sanitize all common areas. In addition, employers must clean and disinfect
            common areas, high-touch-surfaces, and any shared equipment under the employer's control
            that a person who has COVID-19 either used or had direct physical contact with,
            depending on the timing of the exposure.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">What's changed:</span> The amended final rule now only
            requires employers in healthcare settings to regularly clean or sanitize all common
            areas. However, employers must provide employees time and supplies to clean more
            frequently than required, or if they use shared equipment. Employers are still required
            to clean and disinfect areas known to be infected with COVID-19.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Masks:</span></p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">What's Changed:</span> Employers must provide masks, face
            coverings or shields at no cost and allow an employee to wear a face covering even when
            it is not required. They must also implement the indoor mask requirements of OR. Admin.
               <a class="xref" href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/COMMUNICABLEDISEASE/REPORTINGCOMMUNICABLEDISEASE/Documents/rules/2021/Indoor%20and%20outdoor%20masking-1025/333-019-1025-TEMP_Notice-to-IPs__FINAL-updated_11.23.2021.pdf" target="_blank">R. 333-019-1025</a>, unless the person is:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Under 5 years of age (or under 2 years of age in public transportation or transport hubs); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Doing an activity that makes wearing a mask, face covering or face shield not feasible, for instance, while showering, eating, drinking, or sleeping; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Is in a room or vehicle that is shared solely with members of the same household; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Is required to briefly remove their mask, face covering, or face shield because their identity needs to be confirmed, such as security checks at banks or with law enforcement. While the covering is removed, the person should limit their speaking. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Under the amended rule, healthcare employers must also ensure that all individuals in the workplace wear a mask, face covering, or face shield when:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Working inside and social distancing of six feet can't be consistently maintained; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employee shares a room with one or more others and the total square feet does not provide at least 100 square feet per person. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Social Distancing:</span></p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Existing rule: </span>All employers must ensure social
            distancing of six feet from co-workers.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">What's changed:</span> Oregon OSHA only requires the
            implementation of social distancing in healthcare and transit settings. All healthcare
            employers must ensure that work activities and workflows eliminate the need for an
            employee to be within six feet of another person to perform their duties unless the
            employer determines and can show that social distancing is not feasible for certain work
            activities.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Protected Benefits for Medical Removal:</span></p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Existing Rule:</span> Employees ordered to quarantine or
            isolate by a healthcare or local public official (medical removal) must be permitted to
            return to their previous duties, if still available, without any adverse action because
            they had to quarantine or isolate.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">What's Changed:</span> Certain healthcare employers with
            more than 10 employees must provide the following benefits to employees who are engaged
            in direct patient care or in direct support of such care if the employee undergoes
            medical removal:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The benefits the employee would normally be entitled to while working; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Employers with 500 or more employees:
               </span>The same regular (non-overtime) pay the employee would have received had the
               employee not been absent from work, up to a maximum of $1,400 per week, until the
               employee is able to return to work; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Employers with fewer than 500
                  employees:</span> The same benefits as required by employers with 500 or more
               employees, but starting the third week of an employee's removal, an employer may
               reduce the pay to two-thirds of the same regular pay the employee would have received
               had they not been absent from work, up to $200 per day (generally $1,000 per week). </span></li>

         </ul>
