      <p class="p">Colorado has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 20-205) that will require employers to provide paid sick leave and public health emergency leave to employees. The leave must be paid at least at the same rate the employee normally earns during worked hours.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ogs1672211774209__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Paid Sick Leave (All Employers):</h2><p class="p">Effective January 1, 2021, employers with 16 or more employees must provide paid sick leave to their employees. For employers with 15 or fewer employees, this paid sick leave requirement takes effect January 1, 2022.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Accrual and Carryover:</span></p>
<p class="p">Paid sick leave must accrue at a rate of at least one hour for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 48 hours. Accrual begins when employment starts or the applicable effective date, whichever is later. However, employers have the option of providing all the paid sick leave at the beginning of the year, a practice commonly known a frontloading.</p>
<p class="p">Employees are entitled to carry over up to 48 hours of unused paid sick leave to the following year.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Use:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employees may use paid sick leave as it is accrued. The leave may be used for the following purposes:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employee's or a family member's mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee's or a family member's need for a medical diagnosis, care, or treatment related to an illness, injury, or condition; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee or a family member needs to obtain preventive medical care; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee or family member has been the victim of domestic abuse, sexual assault, or harassment and needs to:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">Seek medical attention; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Get assistance from a victims' services organization; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Obtain mental health or other counseling; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Seek relocation services; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Obtain legal services, including preparation and participation in legal proceedings; or </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A public official has ordered the closure of the school or place of care of the employee's child or the employee's place of business due to a public health emergency. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Notice and Documentation:</span></p>
<p class="p">When the need for leave is foreseeable, the employee must make a good-faith effort to provide advance notice and schedule the leave so that it doesn't unduly disrupt the employer's operations. While employers may have a policy with reasonable procedures for providing notice when the need for leave is foreseeable, employers are prohibited from denying leave based on noncompliance with the policy.</p>
<p class="p">For absences of four or more consecutive work days, employers may require reasonable documentation that the leave is for a covered purpose.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ogs1672211774209__section_N10098_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Public Health Emergency Leave (All Employers)</h2><p class="p">In addition to the paid sick leave discussed above, employers must provide public health emergency leave (PHEL) in an amount based on the number of hours the employee works.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Full time employees:</span> Employees who
               normally work 40 hours or more per week are entitled to at least 80 hours of PHEL. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Part-time employees:</span> Employees who
               normally work fewer than 40 hours in a week are entitled to at least the greater of
               either the amount of time the employee is scheduled to work in a 14-day period or the
               amount of time the employee actually works during an average 14-day period. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Employees are only eligible for PHEL in the amounts described above once during the entirety of the public health emergency, even if it is amended, extended, restated, or prolonged. Employees may use PHEL until four weeks after the official public health emergency. Employers may count an employee's unused paid sick leave toward the PHEL the law requires.</p>
<div class="note note" id="ogs1672211774209__note_N100AF_N10098_N10041_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The law doesn't indicate when the PHEL requirements take effect. However, the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) has made clear that all Colorado employers must provide employees access to up to 80 hours of PHEL as of January 1, 2021 due to the COVID-19 public health emergency.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">A public health emergency is defined as:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">An act of bioterrorism, a pandemic flu, or an epidemic caused by a novel and highly fatal infectious agent for which an emergency has been declared by a federal, state, or local public health agency or a disaster emergency declared by the governor; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A highly infectious illness or agent with epidemic or pandemic potential for which a disaster emergency is declared by the governor. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Use:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employees may use PHEL for the following purposes:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">To self-isolate because they are diagnosed with, or experience symptoms of, the communicable illness that is the cause for the public health emergency; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To seek or obtain medical diagnosis, care, or treatment if experiencing symptoms associated with a communicable illness that is the cause of the public health emergency; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To seek preventive care concerning a communicable illness that is the cause of the public health emergency; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If local officials or the employee's employer determines that the individual's presence on the job or in the community would jeopardize the health of others because of the individual's exposure to the communicable illness or because the employee is exhibiting symptoms of the communicable illness (regardless of diagnosis); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To care for a family member to whom any of the above applies; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To care for a child or other family member when the child's care provider is unavailable due to a public health emergency, or if the child's or family member's school or place of care has been closed due to a public health emergency, including if a school or place of care is physically closed but providing instruction remotely; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If an employee is unable to work because the employee has a health condition that may increase susceptibility to or risk of communicable illness that is the cause of the public health emergency. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Notice and Documentation:</span></p>
<p class="p">If the need for leave is foreseeable and the workplace is open, employees must notify their employer as soon as practical. Documentation isn't required for employees to use PHEL.</p>

Since the FFCRA already covers employers with fewer than 500 employees, Senate Bill 20-205 effectively extends the emergency paid sick leave requirements to larger employers so that all employers in the state must now comply with the FFCRA leave requirements. Effective immediately and through December 31, 2020, all employers must provide each employee with emergency paid sick leave for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the amounts and for the purposes specified in the emergency paid sick leave provisions of the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). Since the FFCRA already covers employers with fewer than 500 employees, Senate Bill 20-205 effectively extends the emergency paid sick leave requirements to larger employers so that all employers in the state must now comply with the FFCRA leave requirements. However, the FFCRA also included an exception under which an employer of a healthcare provider or an emergency responder may elect to exclude the employee from the federal emergency paid sick leave requirement. As a result of the new state law, these employees are now entitled to emergency paid sick leave in Colorado. Additionally, under the FFCRA, employers with fewer than 50 employees may be eligible to claim an exemption from the FFRCA's requirement to provide paid leave to an employee who is caring for their child due to their school or place of care being closed, or their childcare provider is unavailable, for COVID-19 related reasons if it would jeopardize the viability of the business. Under the new state law, small employers in Colorado will no longer be able to claim that exemption.</p>
