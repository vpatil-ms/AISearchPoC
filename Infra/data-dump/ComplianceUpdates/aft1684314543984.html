      <p class="p">The Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program (FAMLI) division of the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment has issued a <a class="xref" href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/CODLE/bulletins/3513588" target="_blank">reminder</a> that missed FAMLI employee payroll deductions cannot be made retroactively.</p>

      <section class="section" id="aft1684314543984__section_xlh_d2y_mxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The reminder states that if an employer failed to deduct the employee share of the
            premium from wages paid during any pay period after January 1, 2023, the employer will
            be considered to have elected to pay that portion of the employee's share.</p>

         <p class="p">7 Colo. Code Regs. § 1107-1-1.5 states in part as follows:</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="q">“Employers ability to deduct premiums from employees 1. An employer required to remit
               premiums pursuant to C.R.S. 8-13.3-507 may not deduct more than the maximum allowable
               employee share of the premium from wages paid for a pay period.(a) If an employer
               fails to deduct the maximum allowable employee share of the premium from wages paid
               for a pay period, the employer is considered to have elected to pay that portion of
               the employee share under C.R.S. 8-13.3-507, and the employer cannot deduct this
               amount from a future paycheck of the employee for a different pay period.”</span></p>

         <p class="p">However, where an employee has insufficient wages to cover their share of FAMLI premiums
            for the pay period, an employer is allowed to deduct the uncollected employee portion
            from one or more future pay period paychecks.</p>

      </section>

      <section class="section" id="aft1684314543984__section_fjl_d2y_mxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Next Steps</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Should an employer fail to deduct the employee's share of the FAMLI premium (except in
            cases where the employee had insufficient wages to cover their share), they are
            considered to have elected to pay the employee's premium share and may not deduct wages
            from any future paycheck to make up the missed FAMLI deduction.</p>
