      <p class="p">Chicago has established an ordinance that will require employers to have a written policy on sexual harassment, provide harassment training annually, and display a poster in the workplace beginning July 1, 2022.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wxv1677694832597__section_w295ab1b5b3_w296ab1b5_w297ab1"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2><p class="p">Covered Employers and Employees:</p>
<p class="p">The changes cover any employer that is subject to Chicago licensing requirements or maintains a business facility within city limits. Employees are covered if they are engaged to work in the city for or under the direction or control of another for monetary or other valuable consideration.</p>
<p class="p">Policy Requirements:</p>
<p class="p">Effective July 1, 2022, all covered employers must have a written policy on sexual harassment. The written policy document must include at least the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A statement that sexual harassment is illegal in Chicago. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The new definition of sexual harassment as defined in Section 6-010-020 of the city code:</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"> <span class="q">“Any (i) unwelcome sexual advances or unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature; (ii) requests for sexual favors or conduct of a sexual nature when (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, or (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for any employment decision affecting the individual, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment; or (iii) sexual misconduct, which means any behavior of a sexual nature which also involves coercion, abuse of authority, or misuse of an individual's employment position.”</span></span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A requirement that all employees participate in sexual harassment prevention training annually (see below). </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Examples of prohibited conduct that constitute sexual harassment. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Details on: <ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">How an individual can report an allegation of sexual harassment, including, as appropriate, instructions on how to make a confidential report, with an internal complaint form, to a manager, employer's corporate headquarters or human resources department, or other internal reporting mechanism; and </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Legal services, including governmental, available to employees who may be victims of sexual harassment. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A statement that retaliation for reporting sexual harassment is illegal in Chicago. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The written policy must be available in the employee's primary language within the first calendar week of starting employment. Additionally, employers will be required to display a poster advising of the prohibition on sexual harassment where employees can see it. A model policy and the poster are expected to be made available to employers on the <a class="xref" href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cchr/supp_info/sexual-harassment.html" target="_blank">city's website</a> by July 1, 2022.</p>
<p class="p">Training Requirements:</p>
<p class="p">Covered employees must participate in a minimum of one hour of sexual harassment prevention training annually. Anyone who supervises or manages employees must participate in a minimum of two hours of sexual harassment prevention training annually. All employees must participate in one hour of bystander training annually.</p>

Chicago says that the <a class="xref" href="https://www2.illinois.gov/dhr/Training/Pages/State-of-Illinois-Sexual-Harassment-Prevention-Training-Model.aspx" target="_blank">state's training template</a> , which is one hour, would be sufficient for sexual harassment prevention training required for employees. Training modules for the additional hour of training for supervisors and for the bystander training are expected to be made available to employers on the <a class="xref" href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cchr/supp_info/sexual-harassment.html" target="_blank">city's website</a> by July 1, 2022.</p>
