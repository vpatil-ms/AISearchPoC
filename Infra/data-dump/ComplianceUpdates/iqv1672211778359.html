      <p class="p">California has enacted legislation (Assembly Bill 1731) that makes a number of changes to the existing work-sharing program operated by the Employment Development Department (EDD) to help increase use of the program by employers. The changes are effective immediately, but will be repealed at the end of 2023, unless extended.</p>
