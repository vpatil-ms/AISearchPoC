      <p class="p">The Department of Labor has published a proposed rule that would change the test for determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)</p>

      <section class="section" id="dje1672211777641__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The Department of Labor (DOL) uses an <span class="q">“<a class="xref" href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs13.pdf" target="_blank">economic realities</a>”</span> test to determine whether workers are covered by
            the FLSA and entitled to minimum wage, overtime, and other wage and hour rules.
            Currently, this test looks at the following factors, each carrying equal weight:</p>
<ol class="concept">
            <li><span class="li">The extent to which the services rendered are an integral part of the principal's business. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The permanency of the relationship. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The amount of the alleged contractor's investment in facilities and equipment. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The nature and degree of control by the principal. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The alleged contractor's opportunities for profit and loss. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The amount of initiative, judgment, or foresight in open market competition with others required for the contractor's success. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The degree of independent business organization and operation. </span></li>

         </ol>
<div class="note note" id="dje1672211777641__note_N10079_N10048_N10041_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Different tests are used under other laws, and some states have their own independent contractor tests.</p>

      <section class="section" id="dje1672211777641__section_N10080_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Proposed Rule:</h2><p class="p">The proposed rule would define and clarify how the economic realities test is applied. Under the proposed rule, the ultimate inquiry is whether, as a matter of economic reality, the worker is dependent on a particular individual, business, or organization for work (and is thus an employee) or is in business for themselves (and is thus an independent contractor). Specifically, the proposed rule would sharpen the test into five distinct factors, including:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Two <span class="q">“core factors”</span> that would carry more weight in the analysis (covered in more detail below). These two factors are the nature and degree of the worker's control over the work, and the worker's opportunity for profit or loss based on initiative and/or investment; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Three other factors that would serve as additional guideposts in the analysis: the amount of skill required for the work; the degree of permanence of the working relationship between the worker and the potential employer; and whether the work is part of an integrated unit of production. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="dje1672211777641__section_N10099_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Two Core Factors:</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Nature and Degree of Control:</span></p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Indication of an independent contractor
               relationship:</span> This factor would weigh towards the individual being an
            independent contractor to the extent that the individual, as opposed to the potential
            employer, exercises substantial control over key aspects of work performance. Examples
            include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Setting their own work schedule </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Choosing assignments </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Working with little or no supervision </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Being able to work for others, including a potential employer's competitors </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Indication of an employer/employee relationship: By contrast, the control factor would weigh in
            favor of classification as an employee to the extent that a potential employer, as
            opposed to the individual, exercises substantial control over key aspects of the work,
            including through requirements that the individual work exclusively for the employer
            during the working relationship or prohibiting the individual from working for others
            after that relationship ends.</p>
<p class="p">The proposed rule also would clarify that requiring an individual to comply with specific legal obligations, satisfy health and safety standards, carry insurance, meet contractually agreed-upon deadlines or quality control standards, or satisfy other similar terms that are typical of contractual relationships between businesses (as opposed to employment relationships) doesn't constitute control that makes the individual more or less likely to be an employee.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Opportunity for Profit or Loss Based on
               Initiative/Investment:</span></p>
<p class="p">This factor would weigh towards the individual being classified as an independent contractor if they have an opportunity for profit or loss based on either or both the:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Exercise of personal initiative, including managerial skill or business acumen; and/or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Management of investments in, or capital expenditure on, for example, helpers, equipment, or material. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">While the effects of the individual's exercise of initiative and management of investment are both considered under this factor, the individual wouldn't need to have an opportunity for profit or loss based on both for this factor to weigh towards the individual being an independent contractor. This factor would weigh towards the individual being an employee to the extent the individual is unable to affect their earnings through initiative or investment or is only able to do so by working more hours or more efficiently.</p>

The DOL will then take the comments into consideration as it drafts a final rule. This process typically takes months.</p>
