      <p class="p">Illinois has enacted legislation that clarifies a requirement for employers with 100 or more employees working in Illinois to obtain an Equal Pay Registration Certificate (EPRC). The legislation (House Bill 3733) takes effect January 1, 2024.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ulj1695199187890__section_cgq_w1c_wyb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">In 2021, the state amended the Illinois Equal Pay Act (IEPA) to require that private
            employers report certain payroll information to the Illinois Department of Labor (IDOL)
            and obtain an EPRC. The requirement applies to any private employer that has 100 or more
            employees in Illinois and is required to file an annual EEO-1 with the U.S. Equal
            Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).</p>

         <p class="p">The pay data reporting requirements had originally called for covered employers to file
            their federal EEO-1 with the IDOL, but the IDOL had administratively suspended the EEO-1
            filing requirement for employers who were given an initial filing deadline in the
            calendar year 2023.</p>

         <p class="p">House Bill 3733 codifies that change for future years. As such, employers won't be
            required to submit their federal EEO-1 when they apply for an EPRC in 2024 or
            thereafter.</p>

         <p class="p">To obtain an EPRC, covered employers must certify, among other things, that the average
            compensation for their female and certain other employees isn't consistently below the
            average compensation for their counterparts within each of the major job categories in
            the EEO-1, taking into account factors such as length of service, requirements of
            specific jobs, experience, skill, effort, responsibility, working conditions of the job,
            education or training, job location, use of a collective bargaining agreement, or other
            mitigating factors.</p>

         <p class="p">House Bill 3733 clarifies that for the purposes of the above provision,
               <span class="q">“compensation”</span> means remuneration or compensation an employee receives in return
            for services rendered to an employer, including hourly wages, overtime wages,
            commissions, piece rate work, salary, bonuses, or any other basis of calculation for
            services performed.</p>

         <p class="p">If you have 100 or more employees in Illinois and are required to file an annual EEO-1
            with the EEOC, make sure you comply with the Illinois pay data reporting requirements,
            as amended.</p>
