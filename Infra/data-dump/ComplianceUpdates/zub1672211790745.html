      <p class="p">The California Supreme Court has ruled that the premium pay for failing to provide required meal, rest, and recovery periods must be calculated based on the employee's <span class="q">“regular rate of pay.”</span> This decision means that when calculating the <span class="q">“regular rate of compensation”</span> for the purposes of the premium pay due, employers must include not only wages but also nondiscretionary bonuses, shift differentials, commissions, incentive pay, and other types of nondiscretionary compensation. This interpretation also applies retroactively to premium payments that were made prior to July 15, 2021, the date of the decision.</p>

      <section class="section" id="zub1672211790745__section_N10053_N10044_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Meal Periods:</span></p>
<p class="p">In California, employers must provide employees the opportunity to take an
            uninterrupted 30-minute meal period after no more than five hours of work, unless: (i)
            the total workday is less than six hours; <span class="ph em">and</span> (ii) the
            employer and employee mutually consent to waive the meal period.</p>
<p class="p">The meal period must begin before the end of the fifth hour of work, and the employee must be relieved of all duty during this meal period. If the employee isn't relieved of all duty during the 30-minute meal period, the meal period counts as hours worked, for which the employee must be compensated.</p>
<p class="p">California law also requires employers to provide employees with a second, uninterrupted meal period of at least 30 minutes if an employee works more than 10 hours per day. If an employee works no more than 12 hours, the employer and employee may mutually agree to waive the second meal period, but only if the first meal period was not waived. To satisfy the second meal period requirement, the employee must begin the meal period before the end of the tenth hour of work.</p>
<p class="p">In general, to satisfy California's meal period requirements, employers must actually relieve employees of all duty, relinquish control over their activities, give them a reasonable opportunity to take an uninterrupted 30-minute break (in which they are free to come and go as they please), and must not impede or discourage employees from taking their meal period.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Rest Periods:</span></p>
<p class="p">In California, employers must also give non-exempt employees an uninterrupted rest period for a minimum of 10 minutes for every four hours (or major fraction thereof) worked, unless an employee works less than 3.5 hours in a workday.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Recovery Periods:</span></p>
<p class="p">In California, employers must permit (and encourage) employees who work outside to take a cool-down rest in the shade for at least five minutes when employees feel the need to do so to protect themselves from overheating.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Premium Pay:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers that fail to provide an employee with an opportunity to take a required
            meal, rest, or recovery period must pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the
            employee's <span class="q">“regular rate of compensation”</span> for each workday the
            period isn't provided. This is commonly known as premium pay. An employee is limited to
            one premium <span class="ph em">per break category</span> (rest, meal, recovery) in the
            same day. For example, if an employee wasn't provided a rest, meal, and recovery period
            in compliance with California law on one day, the employee would be entitled to three
            premium payments. However, if an employee missed two meal periods in one day, the
            employee would be entitled to receive only one premium payment.</p>

      <section class="section" id="zub1672211790745__section_N1007F_N10044_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">California Supreme Court Case:</h2><p class="p">The question before the California Supreme Court in <a class="xref" href="https://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S259172.PDF" target="_blank">Ferra v. Loews Hollywood Hotel, LLC</a> was whether <span class="q">“regular rate of
               compensation”</span> regarding premium payments made for missed meal, rest and recovery
            periods, has the same meaning as <span class="q">“regular rate of pay,”</span> a term used for the
            purposes of calculating overtime under federal and state law. The California Supreme
            Court ruled that the terms are indeed synonymous. Thus, employers must also include
            nondiscretionary bonuses, shift differentials, commissions, incentive pay, and other
            types of nondiscretionary compensation when determining the amount of premium pay
            due.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Example:</span></p>
<p class="p"> If an employee works 40 hours one workweek at a rate of $15 per hour and receives a $100 weekly nondiscretionary productivity bonus, the employee's regular rate of pay for purposes of determining premium pay would be calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="p">$15 hourly wage x 40 hours worked = $600 in wages</p>
<p class="p">$600 in wages + $100 productivity bonus = $700 in total compensation for the week</p>
<p class="p">$700 divided by 40 hours worked = $17.50 regular rate of pay. This is the rate at which the premium pay for missed meal, rest and recovery periods should be paid.</p>
<p class="p">These calculations are sometimes more complicated such as when the bonus or other incentive pay is intended to cover a period of more than one workweek, such as a quarterly bonus.</p>

If an employee isn't provided a required meal, rest, or recovery period, the employer must calculate the premium pay due based on the employee's <span class="q">“regular rate of pay”</span> as defined by California law. The California Supreme Court also ruled that its decision applies retroactively. Therefore, employers should review the decision with their legal counsel experienced in California wage and hour law to determine their next steps.</p>
