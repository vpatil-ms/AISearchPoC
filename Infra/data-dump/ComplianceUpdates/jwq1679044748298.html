      <p class="p">On August 24, 2022, President Biden announced an extension of the pause on student loan repayment through December 31, 2022, along with a plan to forgive a certain amount of student loan debt for certain individuals.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jwq1679044748298__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2><p class="p">The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (<span class="q">“CARES Act”</span>) was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act was the third stimulus bill aimed at providing relief to employers and individuals affected by COVID-19. One of the provisions of the CARES Act addressed federal student loans.</p>
<p class="p">Under the CARES Act, re payment of certain federal student loans, including direct loans, Perkins loans and Federal Family Education Loans owned by the United States Department of Education, were automatically suspended from March 13 through September 30, 2020. In addition, interest did not accrue and collection actions and wage garnishments for student loans ceased. Private student loans did not qualify for the relief.</p>
<p class="p">Subsequently, President Biden extended the pause on student loan repayment several times, with the last extension set to expire on August 31, 2022. Then, on August 24, 2022, President Biden announced another extension.</p>
