         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Existing Law</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers with three or more employees are prohibited from discriminating
            against any individual because of their race, color, religious creed, age, sex, gender
            identity or expression, marital status, national origin, ancestry, present or past
            history of mental disability, intellectual disability, learning disability, physical
            disability, or status as a veteran.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Effective October 1, 2022</span></p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph em">All employers</span> are prohibited from
            discriminating against any individual because of their race, color, religious creed,
            age, sex, gender identity or expression, marital status, national origin, ancestry,
            mental disability, intellectual disability, learning disability, physical disability,
            status as a veteran, or <span class="ph em">status as a victim of domestic
               violence</span>.</p>

         <p class="p">All employers are prohibited from denying a reasonable leave of absence
            to employees so they can:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="iwd1679044753852__ul_gd5_tjk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Seek attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, including
               for a child who is a domestic violence victim, so long as the employee isn't the
               perpetrator;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Obtain services, including safety planning, from a domestic violence
               agency or rape crisis center;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Obtain psychological counseling, including for a child, so long as
               the employee did not commit domestic violence against the child;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Take other actions to increase safety from future incidents,
               including temporary or permanent relocation; or</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Obtain legal services, assist in the offense's prosecution, or
               otherwise participate in related legal proceedings.</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Employers with three or more employees must post information concerning
            domestic violence and the resources available to victims of domestic violence in the
            state. The Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities is expected to
            provide a sample notice.</p>

         <p class="p">An employee who is absent from work for a covered reason must, within a
            reasonable time after the absence, provide a certification if requested by the employer.
            The certification must be in the form of:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="iwd1679044753852__ul_hkw_5jk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">A police report indicating that the employee or the employee's child
               was a victim of domestic violence; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A court order protecting or separating the employee or employee's
               child from the perpetrator of an act of domestic violence; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Other evidence from the court or prosecuting attorney that the
               employee appeared in court; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Documentation from a medical professional, domestic violence
               counselor, or other healthcare provider that the employee or the employee's child was
               receiving services, counseling, or treatment for physical or mental injuries or abuse
               resulting in victimization from an act of domestic violence. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Where an employee has a physical or mental disability resulting from an
            incident or series of incidents of domestic violence, the employee must be treated in
            the same manner as an employee with any other disability.</p>

         <p class="p">To the extent permitted by law, employers must maintain the
            confidentiality of any information regarding an employee's status as a victim of
            domestic violence.</p>

         <p class="p">Domestic violence includes incidents resulting in physical harm, bodily
            injury, assault or an act of threatened violence between family or household members. It
            also includes stalking, threatening behavior, or coercive control.</p>
