      <p class="p">Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has issued an executive order that expands protections for certain workers impacted by the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19). The executive order is effective immediately and will continue until the end of the states of emergency and disaster.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ebr1672211771531__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The Michigan Paid Medical Leave Act requires employers with 50 or more employees to provide paid leave to employees for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employee's or a family member's mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee's or a family member's medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition, or preventive medical care;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">For medical care, counseling, obtaining legal services, or participating in a civil or criminal proceeding when the employee or a family member is a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault; and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The closure of the employee's primary workplace or their child's school or place of care due to a public health emergency, or when a health care provider has determined that the employee's or a family member's presence in the community would jeopardize the health of others. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="ebr1672211771531__section_N10065_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Executive Order 2020-36:</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Guidelines:</span></p>
<p class="p">The executive order recommends that all individuals who test positive for COVID-19 or who display one or more of the principal symptoms (fever, atypical cough, or atypical shortness of breath) should remain home until:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Three days have passed since their symptoms have resolved; and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Seven days have passed since their symptoms first appeared or since they were swabbed for the test that yielded the positive result. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">With limited exceptions (such as, healthcare professionals), the order also recommends that those who have had close contact with an individual who tests positive for COVID-19 or with an individual who displays one or more of the principal symptoms of COVID-19 should remain home until either:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">14 days have passed since the last close contact with the sick or symptomatic individual; or</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The symptomatic individual receives a negative COVID-19 test. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employee Protections (applies to all
            employees):</span></p>
<p class="p">The executive order addresses the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Prohibits employers from taking adverse action against an employee for staying home from work while following the guidelines described above. Note: An individual who returns to work prior to the periods specified in the guidelines isn't entitled to this protection.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Requires employers to treat an employee following the guidelines as if they were taking leave under the Paid Medical Leave Act, even if the employer has fewer than 50 employees.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To the extent that the employee has no paid leave, the leave may be unpaid.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The length of leave, whether paid or unpaid, must be extended for as long as the employee remains away from work under the guidelines.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prohibits employers from taking adverse action against an employee for failing to comply with a requirement to document that the employee or the individual with whom the employee has had close contact has one or more of the principal symptoms of COVID-19. </span></li>
