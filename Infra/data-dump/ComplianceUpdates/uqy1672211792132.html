      <p class="p">Maine has enacted legislation (Legislative Document 1622) that will create a state-run retirement program for workers in the private sector. Maine will require employer participation if they have five or more employees and don't offer a retirement plan.</p>

      <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Covered Employers:</span></p>

      <p class="p">Legislative Document 1622 covers employers that haven't offered a specified tax-favored retirement plan at any time within the current calendar year or two preceding calendar years.</p>

      <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Implementation:</span></p>

      <p class="p">The program is scheduled to be implemented as follows:</p>

      <ul class="ul">
         <li><span class="li">Beginning April 1, 2023, covered employers with 25 or more covered employees must offer the program. </span></li>

         <li><span class="li">Beginning October 1, 2023, covered employers with 15 to 24 covered employees must offer the program. </span></li>

         <li><span class="li">Beginning April 1, 2024, covered employers with five to 14 covered employees must offer the program. </span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="p">Covered employers with fewer than five employees aren't required to offer the program.</p>

      <div class="note note" id="uqy1672211792132__note_N10072_N10041_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Any covered employer may voluntarily offer the program to its covered employees on or after April 1, 2023.</p>
</div>

      <p class="p"/>

      <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employer Requirements:</span></p>

      <p class="p">Covered employers must register for the program by the applicable deadline and automatically enroll employees in the state-run plan with the opportunity to opt out. While covered employers must facilitate the program (including withholding employee contributions), they aren't required (or even permitted) to contribute to the plan.</p>

      <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Compliance Recommendations:</span></p>

      <p class="p">Maine employers with five or more employees should determine whether they must participate in the program. Employers that must participate should ensure they offer the program by the applicable deadline.</p>
