      <p class="p">San Francisco has enacted an ordinance that will require employers with 100 or more employees to provide supplemental pay for military leave.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kfn1679044761780__section_m4m_tsl_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Effective February 19, 2023, private employers with 100 or more employees worldwide must
            pay employees who are called for military duty the difference between their gross
            military pay and their gross pay as employees.</p>

         <p class="p">Under the ordinance, military duty is defined as active military service in response to
            the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, international terrorism, the conflict in Iraq,
            or related extraordinary circumstances, or military service to provide medical or
            logistical support to federal, state, or local government responses to the COVID-19
            pandemic, natural disasters, or engagement in military duty ordered for the purposes of
            military training, drills, encampment, naval cruises, special exercises, Emergency State
            Active Duty, or like activity.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kfn1679044761780__section_N10051_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Eligibility</h2><p class="p">To be eligible for the supplemental paid leave, an employee must work within the geographic boundaries of San Francisco and be a member of the reserve corps of the United States Armed Forces, National Guard, or other uniformed service organization of the United States.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="kfn1679044761780__section_N1005B_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employees Who Fail to Return to Work</h2><p class="p">If the employee fails to return to their job within 60 days of release from military duty, the employer has the option of treating the supplemental paid military leave they provided as a loan payable with interest at a rate equal to the minimum amount necessary to avoid imputed income under the Internal Revenue Service Code. In such a case, interest begins to accrue 90 days after the employee's release from military duty or return to fitness for employment, whichever is later. The loan is payable in equal monthly installments over a period not to exceed five years.</p>

            practices to ensure compliance with the ordinance.</p>
