      <p class="p">New York City has enacted an Order that establishes worker COVID-19 vaccination requirements, creates recordkeeping obligations, and includes a posting requirement. The Order took effect on December 27, 2021.</p>

      <section class="section" id="qqh1672211798460__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">All private-sector employers in New York City must verify that their
            employees are vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Covered Workers:</span></p>

         <p class="p">All workers in New York City that perform in-person work or interact with
            the public while conducting business must show proof that they received at least one
            dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, starting <span class="ph strong">December 27, 2021</span>.
            This includes requiring non-employee workers, such as contractors, to provide
            vaccination proof to their employers.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="qqh1672211798460__note_N10057_N10048_N10041_N10001"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b><a class="xref" href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/covid/covid-19-vaccination-workplace-requirement.pdf" target="_blank">The Order</a> does not apply to covered
               entities or individuals that are already subject to another Order of the Commissioner
               of the Department, Board of Health, the Mayor, or a State or federal entity that
               requires them to maintain or provide proof of full vaccination. Entities covered by
               the OSHA ETS rule that allows either employee vaccination or testing must still
               comply with this order and require workers to be vaccinated if they do not have a
               reasonable accommodation.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Workplace Vaccination Requirement:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Workers in New York City that perform in-person work or interact with
            the public while conducting business must show proof that they received at least one
            dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, starting December 27, 2021. After which, workers who
            received a first dose of a two-dose vaccine will have 45 days to show proof of their
            second dose.</p>

         <p class="p">Under the Order, businesses may request that a contractor's employer
            confirm proof of vaccination. Those that do so must keep a log of the requests and
            confirmations.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="qqh1672211798460__note_N1006D_N10048_N10041_N10001"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Workers are prohibited from submitting a weekly negative COVID-19
               test as an alternative to getting vaccinated.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Prohibited Actions:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Businesses are prohibited from allowing an unvaccinated worker to come
            to the workplace. This includes a vehicle if an employee works in the presence of at
            least one other person.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Verifying Worker Vaccinations:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must verify each worker's proof of vaccination. This may be
            done using the <a class="xref" href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page#vaxproof" target="_blank">proofs of vaccination that are accepted for Key to
               NYC</a> (A photo or hard copy of a CDC vaccination card, NYC COVID Safe App, New
            York State Excelsior Pass, CLEAR's Digital Vaccine Card, CLEAR Health Pass, Official
            Vaccine Record, or a photo or hard copy of the official vaccination record of a vaccine
            administered outside the U.S. for one of the following vaccines: AstroZeneca/SK
            Bioscience, Serum Institute of India/COVISHIELD and Vaxzevria, Sinopharm, or
            Sinovac).</p>

         <p class="p">Employers may verify an employee's proof of COVID-19 vaccination by
            either:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Having a copy of a worker's proof of vaccination or a record of
               reasonable accommodation with supporting documentation; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Checking each worker's proof of vaccination before they enter the
               workplace each day and keeping a record of each verification; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">·Creating a paper or electronic record for each worker that includes
               the worker's name, whether the worker is fully vaccinated, and a record of reasonable
               accommodation with supporting documentation. The record for workers who submitted
               proof of their first dose must also contain the date by which the employee can
               provide proof of a second dose (no later than 45 days after submitting proof of the
               first dose). </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Recordkeeping Requirement:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must treat all records that are created or maintained as
            confidential and be prepared to make their records available for inspection, as required
            by law.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Notice Requirement:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must complete and post in a public place a <a class="xref" href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/covid/covid-19-vaccination-workplace-requirement-affirmation.pdf" target="_blank">certificate</a> that affirms they are in
            compliance with the Order. This must be done by December 27, 2021.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Exceptions:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The Order does not require employers to collect proof of COVID-19
            vaccination for people that:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Work alone (at home or otherwise) and who do not have in-person
               contact with co-workers or others while conducting business; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Enter the workplace briefly for a limited purpose (for example:
               using the restroom); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Are non-NYC resident performing artists, college or professional
               athletes, and anyone who accompanies them; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Have requested reasonable accommodations for either medical or
               religious reasons. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Reasonable Accommodation:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Workers who have a sincerely held religious belief (not a social or
            political belief) or a medical condition that prevents them from being vaccination may
            apply for a reasonable accommodation. Workers who request such an accommodation must do
            so by December 27, 2021. While a reasonable accommodation request is pending, employers
            may permit workers to continue coming into the workplace.</p>

         <p class="p">New York City published checklists to guide employers in evaluating
            requests for reasonable accommodations, which can be found <a class="xref" href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/covid/vaccination-workplace-accommodations.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. New York City has stated that employers
            who complete checklists to evaluate accommodation requests should maintain copies to
            serve as a record for any exemptions or accommodations that are granted.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="qqh1672211798460__note_lpq_crk_dwb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>With regard to religious exemption requests, New York City published
               a form that includes questions an employer may ask of employees to determine the
               sincerity of their religious accommodation request. Employers should review the
               questions included on the form with their legal counsel to ensure they comply with
               other antidiscrimination laws that may apply to the employer, such as Title VII and
               the New York State Human Rights Law.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Penalties:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers who refuse to comply may be subject to a fine of $1,000 and
            escalating penalties thereafter if the violations persist.</p>
