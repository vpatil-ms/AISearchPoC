      <section class="section" id="jli1679044761967__section_N10149_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Updated Guidance and Resources</h2><p class="p">The state has now updated <a class="xref" href="https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/paydatareporting/faqs/" target="_blank">answers to frequently asked questions</a> (FAQs), its <a class="xref" href="https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2021/01/CA-Pay-Data-Reporting-User-Guide.pdf?emrc=d6de85" target="_blank">user guide</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/paydatareporting/pdr-excel-templates/" target="_blank">templates</a> to reflect the changes. For example, in the updated FAQs, the state addresses how employers should calculate individual hourly rates, mean hourly rates and median hourly rates, providing the following information.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">How do I calculate an employee's hourly rate?</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers must calculate each employee's individual hourly rate before calculating the mean and median hourly rates. The hourly rate is derived from an employee's total annual earnings for the entire Reporting Year, as shown on the Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 Box 5. To calculate the hourly rate, divide the employee's W-2 Box 5 income by the number of hours the employee worked.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Example:</span></p>

         <p class="p">An employee's W-2 Box 5 income is $100,000 and they worked 2,080
            hours.</p>

         <p class="p">To calculate the employee's hourly rate:</p>

         <p class="p">Divide $100,000 by 2,080 to get: <span class="ph strong">$48.08</span>.</p>

         <p class="p">If an employee has wages not reported in Internal Revenue Service Form
            W-2 Box 5, as may be the case for an H-2A visa holder, for example, use W-2 Box 1 for
            that employee's total annual earnings and divide that amount by the number of hours the
            employee worked.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">How do I calculate the mean hourly
            rate?</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers report the mean hourly rate for each grouping of employees
            with the same establishment, job category, race/ethnicity, and sex combination. The mean
            hourly rate is calculated by adding the individual hourly rates for each employee in the
            group, then dividing that sum by the number of employees in the group.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Example:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employee A and Employee B are the only two employees grouped in the same
            establishment, job category, race/ethnicity, and sex combination.</p>

         <p class="p"> Employee A's hourly rate: $20.00</p>

         <p class="p"> Employee B's hourly rate: $21.00</p>

         <p class="p">To calculate the mean hourly rate for the group:</p>

         <p class="p"> Add Employee A and Employee B's hourly rates ($41.00), and divide by
            the number of employees (2) to get: <span class="ph strong">$20.50</span>.</p>

         <p class="p">If there is only one employee grouped in the same establishment, job
            category, race/ethnicity, and sex combination, that employee's hourly rate is reported
            as the mean hourly rate.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Example:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employee A is the only employee in their same establishment, job
            category, race/ethnicity, and sex combination. Their employer would report Employee A's
            hourly rate ($20.00) as the mean hourly rate.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">How do I calculate the median hourly
            rate?</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers are required to report the median hourly rate for each
            grouping of employees with the same establishment, job category, race/ethnicity, and sex
            combination. The median hourly rate is calculated by ordering the hourly wages of each
            employee in the group from smallest to largest and selecting the middle number.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Example:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employees A, B and C are the only three employees grouped in the same
            establishment, job category, race/ethnicity, and sex combination:</p>

         <p class="p"> Employee A's hourly rate: $20.00</p>

         <p class="p"> Employee B's hourly rate: $21.00</p>

         <p class="p"> Employee C's hourly rate: $22.00</p>

         <p class="p">To calculate the median hourly rate for the group:</p>

         <p class="p"> Arrange all three employees' hourly rates in order from smallest to
            largest ($20.00, $21.00, $22.00), and take the middle number to get: <span class="ph strong">$21.00</span>.</p>

         <p class="p">If there is only one employee grouped in the same establishment, job
            category, race/ethnicity, and sex combination, that employee's hourly rate is reported
            as the median hourly rate.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Example:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employee A is the only employee in their same establishment, job
            category, race/ethnicity, and sex combination. Their employer would report Employee A's
            hourly rate ($20.00) as the median hourly rate.</p>

         <p class="p">If the number of employees in the same establishment, job category,
            race/ethnicity, and sex combination is an even number, the median hourly rate is
            calculated by arranging the hourly wages of each employee in the group from smallest to
            largest and taking the mean of the two middle numbers. If there are only two employees
            in the same category, the median hourly rate would be the same as the mean of their two
            hourly rates.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Example:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Example: Employees A through D are all in the same establishment, job
            category, race/ethnicity, and sex combination.</p>

         <p class="p"> Employee A's hourly rate: $20.00</p>

         <p class="p"> Employee B's hourly rate: $21.00</p>

         <p class="p"> Employee C's hourly rate: $22.00</p>

         <p class="p"> Employee D's hourly rate: $23.00</p>

         <p class="p">To calculate the median hourly rate:</p>

         <p class="p"> Find the mean (the average) of the two middle numbers. In this case,
            you would add $21.00 and $22.00 ($43.00) and divide by two to get: <span class="ph strong">$21.50</span>.</p>

         <p class="p">The guidance also clarifies that employers with multiple establishments
            must submit a single report that includes each establishment.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Does Senate Bill 1162 mean that
               multiple-establishment employers have to submit a separate report for each
               establishment?</span></p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">No.</span> The California pay data reports are
            purposefully designed to consolidate all of an employer's relevant data. For that
            reason, Senate Bill 1162 conformed Government Code section 12999 to the system built by
            the CRD. A multiple-establishment employer submits a single Payroll Employee Report
            and/or a single Labor Contractor Employee Report, depending on which of these reports
            the employers is required to file.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="jli1679044761967__note_jv5_ttl_wwb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The guidance also makes clear that when reporting to the CRD,
               employers must include their employees assigned to California establishments and/or
               working within California. Unlike in years past, employers may not report employees
               who are working outside of California and are assigned to an establishment outside of
               California.</p>
