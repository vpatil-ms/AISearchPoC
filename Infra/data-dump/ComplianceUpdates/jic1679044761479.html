                           training (in person or online) on the premises either as a stand-alone or
                           part of an existing program for any employee that is likely to interact
                           with or come into contact with guests. All current covered employees must
                           receive this training by November 20, 2023, four months from the law's
                           July 20, 2023 effective date. After that, all new covered employees must
                           receive the training within 60 days of their start date.</p>

                        <p class="p">The State, with the Task Force, will make a list of
                           approved programs that will cover, at a minimum, human trafficking, its
                           nature, its definition, how to identify victims, and who to contact if a
                           victim is identified.</p>

                        <p class="p">Recordkeeping Requirements: Employers must maintain a
                           record for each covered employee that shows they completed the training
                           and keep the record on file during the individual's employment and for
                           one year following their termination.</p>

                           Awareness Programs (ATAP). Employers found to have violated the law may
