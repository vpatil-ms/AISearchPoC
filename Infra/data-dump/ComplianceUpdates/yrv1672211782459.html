      <p class="p">Massachusetts has enacted legislation (House Bill 5250) that adds New Year's Day, Columbus Day, and Veterans Day to the phaseout of the state's premium pay requirements for retail workers.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">Up until recently, Massachusetts retail establishments with seven or more employees (including the owner) were required to pay a premium of 1.5 times the employee's regular rate for work on Sundays and certain legal holidays. In 2018, Massachusetts enacted legislation that began to phase out this requirement for Sundays and some of these holidays as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">1.4 times the employee's regular rate on January 1, 2019. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">1.3 times the employee's regular rate on January 1, 2020. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">1.2 times the employee's regular rate on January 1, 2021. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">1.1 times the employee's regular rate on January 1, 2022. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The premium pay requirement will be fully eliminated on January 1, 2023. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The changes enacted in 2018 applied to work performed by retail employees on Sundays, Memorial Day, Labor Day, and Independence Day. Juneteenth Independence Day (June 19) was added later.</p>
<p class="p">Prior to House Bill 5250, all employers were required to pay retail employees 1.5times their regular rate for work on New Year's Day, Columbus Day, and Veterans Day.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">House Bill 5250:</h2><p class="p">House Bill 5250 adds New Year's Day, Columbus Day, and Veterans Day to the phase-out schedule outlined above. Since the law was enacted after January 1, 2021, any work performed by retail employees on New Year's Day 2021 must be compensated at a rate of at least 1.5times their regular rate of pay.</p>
<p class="p">The minimum premium pay requirement for work on Columbus Day and Veterans Day in 2021 will be 1.2. times the employee's regular rate of pay (1.1 in 2022).</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">The phase out may make pay calculations more complicated for workweeks in which employees also work overtime. That's because under federal rules (see 29 CFR778.203), if the premium pay is less than 1.5 times the employee's normal base wage, the premium pay must be included in determining the employee's regular rate of pay for overtime purposes and cannot be credited toward the overtime due. Therefore, adopting a rate lower than 1.5 times the normal base wage could result in an increase in the employer's compensation costs until 2023, when the phase out is complete. Massachusetts employers should take this into consideration as they contemplate implementing the changes in 2021 and 2022.</p>
