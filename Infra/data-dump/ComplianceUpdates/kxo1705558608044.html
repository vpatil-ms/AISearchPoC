      <p class="p">The Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry has updated answers to frequently asked questions about a paid sick leave requirement that went into effect January 1, 2024. All employees who work at least 80 hours in a year for an employer in Minnesota are covered by the paid sick leave law.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kxo1705558608044__section_jbg_zyb_f1c"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The updated guidance is dated December 4, 2023 and addresses various subjects, including
            accrual, front-loading, employee notice, pay during leave, recordkeeping, and more.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Accrual</p>

         <p class="p">The updated guidance clarifies that:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="kxo1705558608044__ul_rvk_bzb_f1c">
            <li><span class="li">Accrual begins immediately when an employee starts working for an employer, even
               before the employee works at least 80 hours in a year for an employer in
               Minnesota.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The law doesn't require employers to credit employees for partial hours of paid sick
               leave, such as a half-hour after 15 hours worked. Employers may credit paid sick
               leave in 30-hour blocks, resulting in one hour of such leave. Employers may also
               choose to credit employees in partial hours of paid sick leave, as long as they are
               earning paid sick leave hours at a rate of at least one hour for every 30 hours
               worked.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Paid sick leave is required to accrue for any employee who works at least 80 hours
               in a year for an employer in Minnesota. If an employee works in another state, the
               employer isn't required to provide paid sick leave under Minnesota law for
               out-of-state hours worked. However, the employee must accrue paid sick leave at a
               rate of at least one hour for every 30 hours worked in Minnesota.</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Front-loading</p>

         <p class="p">The guidance makes clear the law doesn't authorize prorating front-loaded paid sick
            leave hours. An employer must provide at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 30
            hours worked, up to at least 48 hours per year, or front-load at least 48 hours.
            However, an employer could choose to place new employees on an accrual system when
            hired, and then switch them to a front-loaded system at the beginning of the next
            accrual year.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Employee Notice</p>

         <p class="p">An employer can require notice of intent to use paid sick leave up to seven days in
            advance when it is used for a foreseeable reason, according to the guidance. If the
            employer has a written policy regarding the procedures to provide notice up to seven
            days in advance and the employer has provided a copy of this written policy to the
            employee, the employer can deny the employee's request to use paid sick leave if the
            employee did not follow the notice requirements in the policy.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Pay During Leave</p>

         <p class="p">Employers should ensure that employees receive paid sick leave at a rate equivalent to
            the hourly rate they would earn from employment, and in no case can such leave be paid
            at a rate below the applicable minimum wage.</p>

         <p class="p">Some employers pay employees through piece rates, by the mile, a daily rate or another
            non-hourly rate. An employer that uses one of these types of pay systems could calculate
            an hourly rate for employees by, for example, using an employee's last several paychecks
            to divide their total gross earnings by their total hours worked to determine an hourly
            rate for paid sick leave purposes.</p>

         <p class="p">Similarly, an employer could calculate the hourly rate of employees' daily pay by
            dividing their average number of hours worked per day by their daily pay rate.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Recordkeeping</p>

         <p class="p">Minnesota law requires employers to include information about paid sick leave hours
            available for use and used in the pay period on earnings statements provided to
            employees. Simply telling employees how to find information about their paid sick leave
            hours in their timekeeping system won't comply with the requirement, according to the
            guidance. However, in addition to the earnings statement requirement, employers may
            choose to make this information available through their company portal, timekeeping
            software or other accessible systems as well.</p>
