      <p class="p">Santa Clara County (CA) has issued an order that requires employers to determine the vaccination status of all employees and contractors and to take certain other safety measures. The order took effect May 19, 2021 and supersedes the October 5, 2020 Risk Reduction Order of the Health Officer.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ygb1672211787699__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ascertainment of Vaccination Status:</h2><p class="p">All businesses must determine the vaccination status of all <span class="q">“personnel.”</span> The county has
            created a <a class="xref" href="https://covid19.sccgov.org/sites/g/files/exjcpb766/files/Documents/Certification-Vaccination-Status-Form.pdf" target="_blank">sample form</a> for employers to use for this purpose. Until a
            person's vaccination status is ascertained, they must be treated as not fully vaccinated
            (see below). Personnel who decline to provide vaccination status must also be treated as
            unvaccinated.</p>
<p class="p">Businesses must complete their initial determination of vaccination status for all personnel by June 1, 2021. Thereafter, they must obtain updated vaccination status for all personnel who were not fully vaccinated every 14 days. Employers must maintain appropriate records to demonstrate compliance with the provision.</p>
