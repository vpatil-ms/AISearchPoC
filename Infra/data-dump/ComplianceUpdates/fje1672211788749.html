      <p class="p">Washington Governor Jay Inslee has signed Senate Bill 5115, also known as the Health Emergency Labor Standards Act (or HELSA). The HELSA expands worker protections during a public health emergency and requires employers to follow certain notice requirements. Senate Bill 5115 is effective immediately.</p>

<p class="p">Benefits:</p>
<p class="p">Frontline employees who are exposed to infectious or contagious diseases at work are eligible to receive workers' compensation benefits, including time loss or temporary disability benefits the day after the employee contracts the occupational disease. This is defined as the earlier of the date that the employee:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">First missed work due to their symptoms; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Was quarantined by a medical provider or a public health official; or </span></li>

</div>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Reasonable Accommodations:</span></p>
<p class="p">The HELSA prohibits employers from discriminating against a high-risk employee who asks for an accommodation to shield them from being exposed to the infectious disease. If no reasonable accommodation exists, employers must provide employees with all available leave options, including leave without pay and unemployment insurance, until completion of the public health emergency or accommodation is made available.</p>

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Provide written notice to all employees, and the employers of subcontracted employees, who were on the premises at the same worksite that an individual has a positive confirmed case of the infectious or contagious disease. Employers have one business day to provide such notice. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The notice must be in English and in the language understood by the majority of the employer's workforce. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The notice must be made in a manner the employer normally uses to communicate employment-related information, which may include e-mail, text message, personal service, or other methods, if the employer can reasonably anticipate the notice to be received by the employee within one business day. </span></li>
