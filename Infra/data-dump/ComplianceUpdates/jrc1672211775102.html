      <p class="p">San Francisco has approved an emergency ordinance that temporarily creates reemployment and other rights for certain employees laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ordinance went into effect on July 3, 2020 and expires September 1, 2020. Note: The ordinance was extended through January 4, 2021.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jrc1672211775102__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Coverage:</h2><p class="p">The emergency ordinance covers employers with 100 or more employees (as of the earliest date that the employer separated one or more employees that resulted in a layoff). However, employers that provide services that qualify as healthcare operations are exempt from the ordinance.</p>
<p class="p">To be covered by the ordinance, the worker must: (1) be employed by their employer for at least 90 days of the calendar year preceding the date on which their employer provided written notice of layoff; and (2) be separated due to a layoff.</p>
<p class="p">For the purposes of the ordinance, a layoff is defined as separation of 10 or more employees during any 30-day period, commencing on or after February 25, 2020, and which is caused by the employer's lack of funds or lack of work for its employees, resulting from the Public Health Emergency and any shelter-in-place orders. This definition includes any layoff conducted in conjunction with the closure or cessation of an employer's business operations in the city.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jrc1672211775102__section_N10058_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Layoff Notice and Recordkeeping:</h2><p class="p">When an employer implements a layoff after the beginning of the Public Health Emergency, the
            employer must provide all covered workers with written notice on or before the date of
            the layoff. The employer must provide the notice in a language understood by the
            employee. Employers must also notify the Office of Economic and Workforce Development
            (OEWD). See <a class="xref" href="https://sfbos.org/sites/default/files/o0104-20.pdf" target="_blank">the ordinance</a> for details.</p>
<p class="p">The written notice to affected employees must include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A notice of the layoff and the effective date; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A summary of the right to reemployment created by the emergency ordinance (see below); and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A telephone number for the OEWD for the worker to receive information regarding the right to reemployment, as well as other City resources related to unemployment. </span></li>

</div>
<p class="p">Employers that initiate a layoff after the beginning of the Public Health Emergency must keep the following records for each covered worker for at least two years:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Full legal name; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Job classification at the time of separation; </span></li>

      <section class="section" id="jrc1672211775102__section_N1009B_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Offer of Reemployment Following Layoff:</h2><p class="p">Where an employer has initiated a layoff after the beginning of the Public Health Emergency and subsequently seeks to hire a person to a position formerly held by a covered worker, the employer must first offer the position to the covered worker.</p>
<p class="p">Where an employer has initiated a layoff after the beginning of the Public Health Emergency and subsequently seeks to hire a person to any position that is substantially similar to the covered worker's former position and the position is also located in the city, the employer must first offer the position to the covered worker. For the purpose of this provision, a <span class="q">“substantially similar position”</span> includes:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A position with comparable job duties, pay, benefits, and working conditions to the worker's position at the time of layoff; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Any position in which the covered individual worked for the employer in the 12 months preceding the layoff; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Any position for which the covered worker would be qualified, including a position that would necessitate training that an employer would otherwise make available to a new employee for the particular position upon hire. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">In the event an employer separated more than one covered worker from the same job classification, the employer must make offers of reemployment based on the workers' seniority.</p>
<p class="p">The emergency ordinance has specific rules for how the offer of reemployment must be delivered
            and steps for workers to follow to accept the offer. See <a class="xref" href="https://sfbos.org/sites/default/files/o0104-20.pdf" target="_blank">the
               ordinance</a> for details.</p>

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Misconduct.</span> If, based on information
               obtained subsequent to the layoff of a covered worker, the employer learns that they
               engaged in any act of dishonesty, violation of law, violation of policy or rule of
               the employer or other misconduct during their employment with the employer. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Severance Agreement.</span> If: (1) the
               employer separated a covered worker between the beginning of the Public Health
               Emergency and July 3 as part of a layoff; and (2) the employer and the worker
               executed a severance agreement prior to July 3. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Rehiring.</span> If: (1) the employer
               separated the worker between the beginning of the Public Health Emergency and July 3
               as part of a layoff; and (2) prior to July 3, the employer hired another person to
               the position or the substantially similar position. </span></li>

      <section class="section" id="jrc1672211775102__section_N100E1_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reasonable Accommodations for Family Care Hardship:</h2><p class="p">Employers are prohibited from discriminating against or taking adverse action against a covered worker because they are experiencing a family care hardship. Covered workers are also entitled to reasonable accommodation if a family care hardship impacts their ability to perform a job duty or to satisfy a job requirement. In response to a request for accommodation, the employer must make good-faith efforts to reasonably accommodate the individual. For the purpose of this provision, reasonably accommodate includes, but isn't limited to, modifying the worker's schedule, modifying the number of hours worked, or permitting telework, to the extent operationally feasible.</p>
<p class="p">Under the ordinance, a family care hardship is when a covered worker is unable to work due to either:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A need to care for their child whose school or place of care has been closed, or whose childcare provider is unavailable, as a result of the Public Health Emergency, and no other suitable person is available to care for the child during the period of such leave; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Any grounds stated in the San Francisco Paid Sick Leave Ordinance for which a person may use paid sick leave to provide care for someone other than themselves. </span></li>
