      <p class="p">Oregon's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has published a <a class="xref" href="https://osha.oregon.gov/OSHARules/adopted/2021/ao2-2021-letter-cov19-allworkplaces.pdf" target="_blank">final rule</a> that requires employers to follow certain safety
         protocols to stop the spread of COVID-19.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xxb1672211789502__section_N1004F_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">Previously, Oregon published a <a class="xref" href="https://sbshrs.adpinfo.com/covid19-state-emergency-leave-laws#oregon" target="_blank">temporary rule</a> to help control the spread of COVID-19. The temporary rule was in effect through May 4, 2021. The final rule adds and extends certain safety provisions from the temporary rule. The final rule will remain in effect until the state determines it is no longer necessary to address the COVID-19 pandemic and repeals it.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xxb1672211789502__section_N10060_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">New requirements:</h2><p class="p">The final rule added several <a class="xref" href="https://osha.oregon.gov/OSHARules/adopted/2021/ao2-2021-text-cov19-allworkplaces.pdf" target="_blank">provisions</a>, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Clarification that employers who completed actions under the temporary rule, such as training, exposure risk assessments, infection control plans, or posting requirements, do not need to revise or repeat these actions if they had acted in compliance with the temporary rule; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employees in quarantine or isolation for COVID-19 must be allowed to work at home if suitable work is available for them and their condition does not prevent it; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers must notify employees who quarantine or isolate of their right to return to their job (as long as it's available) when their quarantine or isolation period ends. This notification must be in writing; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers with more than 10 employees statewide and an existing HVAC system must
               certify in writing that they're operating that system in accordance with the rule.
               Such certifications can be made using the sample format provided by Oregon. This may
               be done using Oregon OSHA 's <a class="xref" href="https://osha.oregon.gov/OSHAPubs/pubform/covid-19-hvac-certification.pdf" target="_blank">sample format</a> or by other means. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="xxb1672211789502__section_N1008B_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Extended requirements:</h2><p class="p">Under the final rule, employers must continue the following protocols from the <a class="xref" href="https://osha.oregon.gov/OSHARules/div1/437-001-0744.pdf" target="_blank">temporary rule</a>:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Establish a process to notify their employees of potential workplace COVID-19 exposure within 24 hours; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Notify both employees who were within six feet of someone who tested positive for
               COVID-19 for a cumulative total of 15 minutes and employees who worked in the same
               facility or a well-defined portion of the facility. They may also continue to rely on
               Oregon OSHA's <a class="xref" href="https://osha.oregon.gov/Documents/Model-COVID-19-Notification-Policy.pdf" target="_blank">model policy</a> for this purpose; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Continue to follow the exceptional risk workplace and industry-specific guidelines *</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">* Note: While the final rule also required employees and visitors to continue physical distancing
            and use face masks in the workplace, Oregon Governor Kate Brown recently signed <a class="xref" href="https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_21-15.pdf" target="_blank">Executive Order No. 21-15</a>, which lifted the statewide mask
            mandate and requirements for physical distancing indoors, effective June 30, 2021. In
            following the Executive Order, OR OSHA lifted workplace rules that required masks and
            physical distancing on June 30, 2021.</p>
