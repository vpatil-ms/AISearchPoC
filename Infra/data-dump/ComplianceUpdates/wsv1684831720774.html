      <p class="p">Florida has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 1718) that requires employers
         with 25 or more employees to use E-Verify to confirm a new hire is eligible to work in the
         United States. The requirement takes effect <span class="ph strong">July 1, 2023</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wsv1684831720774__section_nbq_x2g_4xb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">By way of background, E-Verify is an internet-based system operated by the federal
            government that enables employers to determine a new hire's eligibility to work in the
            United States. Notably, employers that use E-Verify must still complete a Form I-9 for
            each new hire.</p>

         <p class="p">For employees hired on or after July 1, 2023, Florida employers with 25 or more
            employees must use E-Verify to confirm the newly hired employee is eligible to work in
            the United States. These employers must retain a copy of the documentation provided and
            any official verification generated, if applicable, for at least 3 years.</p>

         <p class="p">Under the new law, an employer may not continue to employ a worker after obtaining
            knowledge that the individual is unauthorized to work in the United States.</p>

         <p class="p">If the E-Verify system is unavailable for 3 business days after the first day that the
            new employee begins working, and an employer cannot access the system to verify a new
            employee's employment eligibility, the employer must still complete the Form I-9 and
            document the unavailability of the E-Verify system.</p>

         <p class="p">The employer must do the latter by retaining a screenshot from each day that shows the
            employer's lack of access to the system, a public announcement that the E-Verify system
            is unavailable, or any other communication or notice recorded by the employer regarding
            the unavailability of the system.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers that are required to use E-Verify must also certify on their first return each
            calendar year to the state's tax service provider that they are in compliance with the
            requirement when making contributions to or reimbursing the state's unemployment
            compensation or reemployment assistance system.</p>

         <p class="p">Starting on July 1, 2024 penalties for non-compliance with the E-Verify requirements
            include potential Florida Department of Economic Opportunity fines of $1,000 per day
            until the employer provides sufficient proof to the department that the noncompliance
            was resolved as well as the potential for suspension of a business license.</p>

         <p class="p">Employee-leasing companies that specifically place the primary obligation for E-Verify
            compliance upon client companies—in <span class="q">“a written agreement or memorandum of
               understanding”</span>—will <span class="q">“not [be] required to verify employment eligibility of any
               new employees of the client compan[ies].”</span></p>
