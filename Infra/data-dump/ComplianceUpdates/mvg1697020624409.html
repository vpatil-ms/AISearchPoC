      <p class="p">The state of New York has enacted <a class="xref" href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S5572" target="_blank">Senate Bill 5572/Assembly Bill 6796</a>, which increases the earnings threshold for exemption from certain wage payment protections under the New York Labor Law.</p>

      <section class="section" id="mvg1697020624409__section_xcl_nyr_bzb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Currently, individuals employed in an executive, administrative, or professional
            capacity who earn in excess of $900 per week are exempt from certain wage payment
            protections relating to, among other things, pay frequency and direct deposit consent.
            As of March 13, 2024, the earnings threshold will increase to $1,300 per week, and
            employees who earn $1,300 or less will be subject to these wage payment protections.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="mvg1697020624409__note_alv_nyr_bzb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The increased threshold does not impact the weekly earnings threshold that workers
               employed in a bona fide executive or administrative capacity must earn to be exempt
               from overtime pay requirements.</p>
