      <p class="p">Alabama has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 9) that prohibits employers from requiring employees to receive COVID-19 vaccination without providing the employee an opportunity to seek an exemption for religious or medical reasons. Senate Bill 9 is effective immediately and expires on May 1, 2023.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Exemption Form Required:</h2><p class="p">Under Senate Bill 9, employers must provide an exemption from COVID-19 vaccination requirements to any employee who has completed and submitted the exemption form shown below. The form must be completed and signed by the employee and if applicable, signed by a healthcare provider. The form must read as follows:</p>
<p class="p">Any individual in the State of Alabama who is subject to a requirement that he or she receive one or more COVID-19 vaccinations as a condition of employment may claim an exemption for medical reasons, because the vaccination conflicts with sincerely held religious beliefs, or both.</p>
<p class="p">You may request either a medical or a religious exemption from the COVID-19 vaccination by completing this form and submitting the form to your employer.</p>
<p class="p">In the event your employer denies this request, you have a right to file an appeal with the Department of Labor within 7 days. Your employer will provide you with information on how to file an appeal.</p>
<p class="p">I am requesting exemption from the COVID-19 vaccine requirements for one of the following reasons: (check all that apply)</p>
<p class="p">________ My health care provider has recommended to me that I refuse the COVID-19 vaccination based on my current health conditions and medications. (NOTE: You must include a licensed health care provider's signature on this form to claim this exemption.)</p>
<p class="p">________ I have previously suffered a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) related to vaccinations in the past.</p>
<p class="p">________ I have previously suffered a severe allergic reaction related to receiving polyethylene glycol or products containing polyethylene glycol.</p>
<p class="p">________ I have previously suffered a severe allergic reaction related to receiving polysorbate or products containing polysorbate.</p>
<p class="p">________ I have received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma as part of a COVID-19 treatment in the past 90 days.</p>
<p class="p">________ I have a bleeding disorder or am taking a blood thinner.</p>
<p class="p">________ I am severely immunocompromised such that receiving the COVID-19 vaccination creates a risk to my health.</p>
<p class="p">________ I have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past 12 months.</p>
<p class="p">________ Receiving the COVID-19 vaccination conflicts with my sincerely held religious beliefs, practices, or observances.</p>
<p class="p">I hereby swear or affirm that the information in this request is true and accurate. I understand that providing false or misleading information is grounds for discipline, up to and including termination from employment.</p>
<p class="p">_________________________________________________________________</p>
<p class="p"> Employee's Printed Name</p>
<p class="p">_________________________________________________________________</p>
<p class="p"> Employee's Signature</p>
<p class="p">______________________________________________________</p>
<p class="p"> Date</p>
<p class="p">(Note: The following must be completed ONLY if claiming the first medical exemption listed above.)</p>
<p class="p">Certification by a licensed health care provider as to the accuracy of information provided above:</p>
<p class="p">_________________________________________________________________</p>
<p class="p"> Name of Health Care Provider</p>
<p class="p">_________________________________________________________________</p>
<p class="p"> Signature of Health Care Provider</p>
<p class="p">________________________________________________</p>
<p class="p"> Date</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Providing the Form:</h2><p class="p">Employers must make the form readily available to all employees to whom the law applies, along with directions for submitting the form.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Evaluating the Request:</h2><p class="p">When evaluating an employee's exemption request, the employer must liberally construe the employee's eligibility for an exemption in favor of the employee, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p class="p">Under the law, the submission of the completed form creates a presumption that the employee is entitled to the exemption.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employee Protections:</h2><p class="p">An employer who has denied an employee's request is prohibited from terminating the employee on the basis of failing to receive a vaccination for a period of 7 calendar days after the denial was issued by the employer, or if an appeal was made, until the administrative law judge or the court issues a final ruling in the employer's favor. During this period, the employer must compensate the employee at the same rate of pay the employee received prior to submitting an exemption form.</p>
<div class="note note"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The Alabama Department of Labor is responsible for establishing an emergency rule for the appeal process within 21 days. The employee must file the appeal no later than the latter of 7 calendar days following the denial of a request for an exemption or 3 business days following the adoption of the rule.</p>
</div>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">Alabama employers should consult legal counsel to discuss the impact of Senate Bill 9 on their vaccination policies and practices.</p>
