      <p class="p">California has enacted legislation (Assembly Bill 2282), which clarifies the
         state's hate crimes law as it pertains to the workplace, and increases the potential
         penalties. It takes effect <span class="ph strong">January 1, 2023</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="gjk1679044756051__section_um3_wxk_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">By way of background, existing law considers the symbol of the Nazi party (commonly
            referred to as a <span class="q">“swastika”</span>), the noose, and the burning cross as hate symbols and
            criminalizes their use to terrorize others. However, state law has had different rules
            both in terms of punishment and the location in which these symbols are expressly
            prohibited. The purpose of Assembly Bill 2282 is to align the law in these areas.</p>

         <p class="p">Assembly Bill 2282 now makes clear that the display of these and other symbols is
            prohibited in the workplace if used for the purpose of terrorizing a person who works at
            or is otherwise associated with the workplace.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="gjk1679044756051__note_n2n_xxk_wwb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The law states that the intent of the legislature isn't to criminalize ancient
               swastika symbols that are associated with Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism and are
               symbols of peace.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p">Assembly Bill 2282 also increases the penalty for a first conviction for violating the
            law to up to three years in county jail and/or a fine of up to $10,000 for a felony
            conviction and $5,000 for a misdemeanor conviction. For subsequent convictions, the
            maximum fine increases to $15,000 for a felony and $10,000 for a misdemeanor.</p>
