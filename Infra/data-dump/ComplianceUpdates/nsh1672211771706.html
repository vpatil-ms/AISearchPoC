      <p class="p">The District of Columbia has enacted an emergency ordinance that requires employers with 50-499 employees to provide paid leave to employees impacted by COVID-19. The emergency ordinance also temporarily expands the D.C. Family and Medical Leave Act (DCFMLA). The emergency ordinance took effect immediately and has been extended until November 16, 2020.</p>

      <section class="section" id="nsh1672211771706__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">DC's Accrued Sick and Safe Leave Act (<span class="q">“the Act”</span>) requires employers to provide paid leave for an absence resulting from:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">An employee's, or their family member's, physical or mental illness, injury, or medical condition; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employee's, or their family member's, need to obtain a professional medical diagnosis or care; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Stalking, domestic violence, or sexual abuse and the absence is directly related to medical, social, or legal services for the employee or their family member. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The DCFMLA requires employers with 20 or more employees to provide eligible employees with 16 weeks of unpaid family and medical leave during a 24-month period. To be eligible, an employee must:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Have been employed by the employer for at least one year without a break in service; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Worked at least 1,000 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the requested leave. </span></li>

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employee is subject to a federal, state, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19 or is caring for an individual who is subject to such an order. </span></li>

<p class="p">In such cases, any otherwise eligible employee may receive unemployment benefits regardless of whether the:</p>
<ul class="ul">
