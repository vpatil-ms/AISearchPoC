      <p class="p">Connecticut has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 1201) that will allow
         adults to use recreational marijuana in the state beginning July 1, 2021. Senate Bill 1201
         also includes certain employment protections for recreational marijuana use outside of
         work. The employment-related provisions generally take effect <span class="ph strong">July
            1, 2022</span>. The following is a summary of these provisions.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jhu1672211789858__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Senate Bill 1201:</h2><p class="p">With limited exceptions, an employer may maintain a drug-free workplace and implement a policy prohibiting the possession, use, or consumption of cannabis by an employee, provided such policy is in writing, in either physical or electronic form, and made available to each employee prior to enactment. The employer must also make the policy available to each prospective employee at the time an offer or conditional offer of employment is made.</p>
<p class="p">Notably, one of the exceptions that employers must make to the policy is for off-duty use of medical marijuana by qualifying patients. Employers must also allow qualifying patients to possess medical marijuana.</p>
<p class="p">Employers are generally prohibited from taking adverse action against employees because they use cannabis products outside of the workplace, unless the action is made pursuant to the written policy described above.</p>

            <li><span class="li">The drug test was pursuant to a random drug testing policy (if permitted by state law) and the employer has an established policy that a positive drug test for THC may result in an adverse employment action. </span></li>
