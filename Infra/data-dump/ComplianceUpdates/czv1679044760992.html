      <p class="p">The Pennsylvania Independent Regulatory Review Commission has approved amendments to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA), which provide new definitions of race, sex and religious creed, and effectively protect against hairstyle discrimination. The new rules are set to take effect within 60 days of their publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin.</p>

      <section class="section" id="czv1679044760992__section_y4h_2ql_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The PHRA, and its <a class="xref" href="http://www.irrc.state.pa.us/docs/3339/AGENCY/3339FF.pdf" target="_blank">amended rules</a>, cover discrimination in employment, housing, commercial
            property, education, and public accommodations and apply to businesses that employ four
            or more individuals or independent contractors.</p>

         <p class="p">The amendments expand the following definitions of protected categories that were not
            previously expressly covered under the law:</p>

<p class="p">The law also protects traits historically associated with race, including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Hair texture; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Protective hairstyles (such as braids, locks and twists); and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Note: If your policy simply indicates that employees must maintain kempt hair,
               consider clarifying that kempt means that the hair is clean and well combed or
               arranged, and that employees can comply with a variety of hairstyles that meet those
               criteria.</span></li>
