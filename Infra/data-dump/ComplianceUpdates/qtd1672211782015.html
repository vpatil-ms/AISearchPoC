      <p class="p">Michigan has adopted legislation (Senate Bill 1258) that amends the rules for returning to work after testing positive for COVID-19, displaying symptoms of COVID-19, or having close contact with someone who has COVID-19. Senate Bill 1258 is effective immediately.</p>

      <section class="section" id="qtd1672211782015__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">In October 2020, Michigan enacted legislation (House Bill 6032) that prohibited:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Employees who test positive for COVID-19 or who display the principal symptoms of COVID-19 from reporting to work until certain conditions are met. Among other conditions, these employees had to wait until 10 days had passed since their symptoms first appeared or they received a positive COVID-19 test, whichever was later. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employees who have close contact with an individual who tests positive for COVID-19 or with an individual who displays the principal symptoms of COVID-19 from reporting to work until 14 days have passed since the employee last had close contact with the individual or the close contact receives a medical determination that they didn't have COVID-19 at the time of the close contact with the employee. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers from discharging, disciplining, or otherwise retaliating against an employee who complies with the return to work conditions prescribed in the law, opposes a violation of the law, or reports health violations related to COVID-19. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="qtd1672211782015__section_N10061_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Senate Bill 1258:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Senate Bill 1258 removes the specific timeframes (10 days and 14 days)
            from the return-to-work requirements for COVID-19 and makes other changes.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employees Who Test Positive:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employees who test positive for COVID-19 are prohibited from reporting
            to work until:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employee is advised by a healthcare provider or public health
               professional that they have completed their isolation period; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">All of the following conditions are met:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">If the employee has a fever, 24 hours have passed since the
                     fever has stopped without the use of fever-reducing medications. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">If the employee displays the principal symptoms of COVID-19,
                     those symptoms have improved. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">If the employee has been advised by a healthcare provider or
                     public health professional to remain isolated, they are no longer subject to
                     that advisement. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The isolation period has passed. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Under the law, the isolation period means the recommended number of days
            for an individual to be in isolation after they first display the principal symptoms of
            COVID-19 as prescribed in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s
            COVID-19 guidelines.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Symptomatic Employees:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The law also clarifies that an employee who displays the principal
            symptoms of COVID-19 but hasn't tested positive is prohibited from reporting to work
            until:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employee receives a negative diagnostic test result; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">All of the following conditions are met:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">If the employee has a fever, 24 hours have passed since the
                     fever has stopped without the use of fever-reducing medication. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The symptoms have improved. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The isolation period has passed since the symptoms began.
                  </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Close Contact:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employees who have had close contact with an individual who tests
            positive for COVID-19 are prohibited from reporting to work until one of the following
            conditions is met:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The quarantine period has passed since the employee last had close
               contact with the individual; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee is advised by a healthcare provider or public health
               professional that they have completed their quarantine period. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Quarantine period means the recommended number of days for an individual
            to be in quarantine after they are in close contact as prescribed in CDC COVID-19
            guidelines.</p>

         <p class="p">Senate Bill 1258 also establishes that the definition of close contact
            is how that term is defined in CDC COVID-19 guidelines at the time the contact
            occurred.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Exception:</span></p>

         <p class="p">There is an exception that allows certain types of employees who are
            otherwise subject to quarantine but aren't experiencing any symptoms and haven't tested
            positive for COVID-19 to participate in onsite operations. This only applies when
            strictly necessary to preserve the function of a facility in which ceasing facility
            operations would cause serious harm or danger to public health or safety. See the <a class="xref" href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2019-2020/publicact/htm/2020-PA-0339.htm" target="_blank">text of the law</a> for details.</p>
