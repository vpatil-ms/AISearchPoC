<p class="p">The requirements won't apply to building and construction industry employees who are represented by a building and construction trades labor organization if a valid waiver of these requirements is provided in a collective bargaining agreement.</p>

<p class="p">Employees are entitled to begin accruing paid sick leave on January 1, 2024, or their date of hire, whichever is later. Employees must accrue a minimum of one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 48 hours in a year.</p>
<p class="p">Employers must typically permit employees to carry over accrued but unused sick leave into the following year. However, employers may cap total accrual at 80 hours.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Frontloading</span></p>
<p class="p">In lieu of allowing carryover into the following year, an employer may provide an employee with paid sick leave for the year that meets or exceeds the requirements of the law that is available for the employee's immediate use at the beginning of the subsequent year as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">48 hours, if an employer pays an employee for accrued but unused paid sick leave at the end of a year at the same hourly rate as an employee earns from employment; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">80 hours, if an employer doesn't pay an employee for accrued but unused paid sick leave at the end of a year at the same or greater hourly rate as an employee earns from employment. </span></li>

If the need is not foreseeable, an employer may require an employee to give notice of the need for leave as soon as practical. An employer that requires notice of the need to use paid sick leave must have a written policy containing reasonable procedures for employees to provide notice, and must provide a written copy of such policy to employees.</p>
<p class="p">If the absence is more than three consecutive days, the employer may require reasonable documentation that the absence is covered by the law. See the <a class="xref" href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/laws/2023/0/Session%2bLaw/Chapter/53/" target="_blank">text of the law</a> for details on what is considered reasonable documentation.</p>

The notice must include specified information and must be provided in English and the primary language of the employee. The notice must be provided by January 1, 2024 or at the start of employment, whichever is later. The Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry will prepare a uniform employee notice that employers can use and will make it available in English and the five most common languages spoken in Minnesota.</p>
<p class="p">The means used by the employer must be at least as effective as the following options for providing notice:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Posting a copy of the notice at each location where employees perform work and where the notice must be readily observed and easily reviewed by all employees performing work; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A conspicuous posting in a web-based or app-based platform through which an employee performs work. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Employers that provide an employee handbook to their employees must include in the handbook the notice of employee rights under the law.</p>
<p class="p">In addition to the employment and payroll records required by the state, an employer must maintain accurate records for each employee showing hours of work as well as the paid sick leave taken. The records must be retained for a period of at least three years. An employer must allow an employee to inspect records at a reasonable time and place.</p>
<p class="p">Wage statements must include the total number of paid sick leave hours accrued and available for use as well as the amount of sick leave hours used during the pay period.</p>
<p class="p">Existing local paid sick leave local ordinances</p>
<p class="p">Paid sick leave ordinances already exist in certain cities in Minnesota. When Minnesota's paid sick leave law goes into effect January 1, 2024, employers must follow the most protective law that applies to their employees.</p>
