      <p class="p">Oregon has enacted a final rule that requires employers to take certain
         safety steps related to wildfire smoke exposure. The final rule takes effect on <span class="ph strong">July 1, 2022</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wbs1679044751740__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">Due to an increase in wildfires, Oregon employees have faced increased health risks associated with wildfire smoke inhalation when the air quality is at or above a certain <a class="xref" href="https://osha.oregon.gov/OSHARules/adopted/2022/ao4-2022-text-smoke-exposure.pdf" target="_blank">threshold</a> .</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="wbs1679044751740__section_N10051_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Under the final rule, Oregon employers must implement wildfire smoke
            training, monitor employee smoke exposure levels and <a class="xref" href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators/default.html" target="_blank">filtering facepiece respirators</a> use, and communicate related
            smoke hazards to employees.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Monitoring and Controlling Exposure:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must monitor their worker's exposure to wildfire smoke and
            measure the air quality when employees are, or are likely to be, exposed to certain
            levels of particulate matter. They must take measurements at the start of each shift and
            during the day as needed, and use one or more of the following methods:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Check the current average and forecasted AQI value for PM2.5 </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Monitor air quality advisories due to wildfire smoke </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Directly measure workplace air quality for PM2.5 using the testing
               device's instructions </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Employers must also implement safety controls whenever employees are
            exposed to AQI levels that meet or exceed 101, 251 and 501. See the <a class="xref" href="https://osha.oregon.gov/OSHARules/adopted/2022/ao4-2022-text-smoke-exposure.pdf" target="_blank">text of the law</a> for further details.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Training Requirements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must provide annual training to every employee that may
            experience exposure to certain air quality levels. The training must be provided before
            employees may be exposed to smoke, and be in a language and vocabulary readily
            understood, given in a way that facilitates employee feedback, and at a minimum,
            cover:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The symptoms, risks, and acute and chronic health effects of
               wildfire smoke exposure (including chronic exposure); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Information on filtering facepiece respirators, such as: <ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">Their importance, limitations and benefits; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">How to use and maintain them; and </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Which job tasks workers should not perform while using
                     respirators due to increased health risks. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Steps for supervisory personnel to follow when an employee reports
               or has symptoms indicating a need for immediate medical attention (asthma attacks,
               chest pain, difficulty breathing, etc.); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employee's right to report health issues related to wildfire
               smoke exposure and get medical treatment without the fear of retaliation; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employer implemented protections, such as: <ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">Explaining the two-way communication system for wildfire smoke
                     exposure control and making required filtering facepiece respirators readily
                     accessible. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">How employees can obtain: <ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">The current average and forecasted ambient air concentration
                     for PM2.5 and equivalent AQI value for their work location; and </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Respirators before exposure (and replace them when needed).
                  </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">How workers can operate and interpret smoke exposure results. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employer Communication Requirements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must create and implement a two-way communication system to
            share wildfire smoke information between supervisors and employees. The system must
            notify exposed employees to any changes in air quality, and encourage employees to relay
            changes in air quality, issues with exposure control and health symptoms that may
            require medical attention.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Recordkeeping Requirements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must keep training records for each employee. The records must
            be kept for one year and include an employee's name or ID number, training dates and
            each trainer's name.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Exceptions:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The final rule exempts the following locations and circumstances from
            these requirements:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Employees who work from home; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When an employer predetermines that its operations will be suspended
               to prevent employee exposure to wildfire smoke (at an air quality level that meets or
               exceeds the threshold); or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Enclosed buildings where the air is filtered by a ventilation system
               and enclosed vehicles where the air is filtered by a properly maintained cabin air
               filter system. </span></li>

         </ul>

            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Both the building and vehicles must have windows, doors, bays, and
               other exterior openings that are kept closed, except when necessary to briefly enter
               or exit.</p>
