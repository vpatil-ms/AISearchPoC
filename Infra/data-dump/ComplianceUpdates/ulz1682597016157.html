      <p class="p">Connecticut employers with five to 25 employees will now have until August 31, 2023 to register with the MyCTSavings program, if they don't offer a retirement plan. MyCTSavings is a state-run, payroll withholding savings program using Roth Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).</p>

      <section class="section" id="ulz1682597016157__section_m1d_rf3_jxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Connecticut employers with five or more employees in the state — at least five of whom
            have been paid more than $5,000 in the calendar year — are required to register with and
            facilitate the MyCTSavings program, if they don't offer a retirement plan. These
            employers must also provide employees with information on the state program, enroll
            employees in the program, and deduct and remit employee contributions.</p>

         <p class="p">Initially, the deadline for employers with five to 25 employees to register with
            MyCTSavings was March 30, 2023. However, the state has extended the registration
            deadline for these employers to August 31, 2023. The deadline for larger employers has
            already passed.</p>
