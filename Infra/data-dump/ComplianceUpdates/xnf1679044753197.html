      <p class="p">A federal judge has granted a preliminary injunction blocking a Florida law that prohibits employers with 15 or more employees from subjecting an individual to training that endorses certain concepts about discrimination.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xnf1679044753197__section_nyt_bnk_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Earlier this year, Florida enacted House Bill 7, which took effect July
            1, 2022. Among other things, House Bill 7 established that employers with 15 or more
            employees engage in an unlawful employment practice if they subject individuals to
            training that promotes, advances, or compels the individual to believe any of <a class="xref" href="/fl-restricts-employee-training-on-certain-concepts" target="_blank">eight specified concepts</a> on race, color, sex,
            or national origin. For instance, the law barred training that indicated an individual's
            moral character or status as either privileged or oppressed is necessarily determined by
            their race, color, sex, or national origin.</p>

         <p class="p">After the law was passed, a lawsuit was filed by two employers and a training consultant
            who wished to provide training they believed was now barred by House Bill 7.</p>

         <p class="p">In the lawsuit, the employers and consultant argued that House Bill 7 is an unlawful
            restriction on speech and overly broad and vague. They also filed a motion asking the
            court for a preliminary injunction against the state.</p>

         <p class="p">On August 18, 2022, U.S. District Judge Mark E. Walker granted the motion for a
            preliminary injunction. The ruling prevents the state from enforcing the
            workplace-training provisions of House Bill 7 while the lawsuit is still being
            litigated. However, individuals may still be able to pursue private causes of action
            based on the law.</p>
