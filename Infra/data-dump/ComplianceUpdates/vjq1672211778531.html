      <p class="p">California has enacted legislation (Assembly Bill 1963) that will add certain human
         resource employees to the mandatory reporting requirement for child abuse and neglect.
         Assembly Bill 1963 takes effect <span class="ph strong">January 1, 2021</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="vjq1672211778531__section_N1004D_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The California Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act requires a mandated reporter to report whenever they, in their professional capacity or within the scope of their employment, have knowledge of or observed a child who the mandated reporter knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse or neglect. Failure by a mandated reporter to report an incident of known or reasonably suspected child abuse or neglect is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail, a fine of $1,000, or both imprisonment and a fine. Under existing law, employers are strongly encouraged to provide their employees who are mandated reporters with training in these duties, including training in identification and reporting of child abuse and neglect. Schools are required to provide such training.</p>

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">They work for a business with five or more employees; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The business employs minors. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">For the purposes of the law, a <span class="q">“human resource employee”</span> is one designated by the employer to accept any complaints of misconduct under the state's laws prohibiting discrimination and other unlawful practices.</p>
<p class="p">The law also adds, for the purposes of reporting sexual abuse, an adult whose duties require direct contact with, and supervision of, minors in the performance of the minors' duties to the list of individuals who are mandated reporters.</p>
