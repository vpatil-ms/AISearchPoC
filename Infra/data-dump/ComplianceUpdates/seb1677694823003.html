      <p class="p">Connecticut has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 163) that prohibits
         employers from disciplining employees for refusing to attend an employer-sponsored meeting
         concerning religious or political matters. Senate Bill 163 takes effect <span class="ph strong">July 1, 2022</span>. Notably, the law's definition of political
         matters includes organized labor.</p>

      <section class="section" id="seb1677694823003__section_N10050_N10049_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2><p class="p">Under the law, employers are prohibited from disciplining or threatening to discipline an employee for their refusal to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Attend an employer-sponsored meeting that has the primary purpose of communicating the employer's opinion concerning religious or political matters; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Listen to speech or view a communication that has the primary purpose of communicating the employer's opinion concerning religious or political matters. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The law defines political matters as those relating to elections for political
            office, political parties, proposals to change legislation, proposals to change
            regulation and the decision to join or support any political party or political, civic,
            community, fraternal or <span class="ph em">labor organization</span>.</p>
<p class="p">Under the law, religious matters are defined as those relating to religious affiliation and practice and the decision to join or support any religious organization or association.</p>
<div class="note note" id="seb1677694823003__note_N1006A_N10050_N10049_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Existing law already prohibited employers from disciplining employees for exercising their rights guaranteed by the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution or section 3, 4 or 14 of article first of the state Constitution, provided such activity doesn't substantially or materially interfere with the employee's bona fide job performance or the working relationship between the employee and the employer. Senate Bill 163 amends this provision to also expressly prohibit employers from threatening to discipline employees for exercising such rights.</p>
