<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Gross and net wages earned </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Total hours worked </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The number of piece-rate units earned and any applicable piece rate if the employee is paid on a piece-rate basis </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">All deductions </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The pay period covered </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The name of the employee and the last four digits of their Social Security Number or employee identification number </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The name and address of the employer legal entity </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">All applicable hourly rates in effect during the pay period and the corresponding number of hours worked at each hourly rate by the employee. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Timing of Pay:</span></p>
<p class="p">Under California Labor Code 204, wages must generally be paid at least twice during each calendar month on the days designated in advance as regular paydays.</p>

               Delta Air Lines, Inc.</cite>), the California Supreme Court was asked to clarify
            whether Section 226 and Section 204 apply to airline employees who perform much of their
            work in airspace outside California's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="p">The court ruled that whether Section 226 and Section 204 apply to interstate
            employees depends on whether their principal place of work <span class="ph em">during
               the relevant pay period</span> is in California.</p>
<p class="p">This test is satisfied if the employee spends a majority of their time working in California during the relevant pay period. For pilots, flight attendants, and other interstate transportation workers who don't perform a majority of their work in any one state, this test is satisfied when California serves as their base of work operations. For the test, it doesn't matter if the employee lives in California, whether the employer is based in California, or whether a collective bargaining agreement governs the employee's pay, the court said.</p>
