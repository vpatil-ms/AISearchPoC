      <section class="section" id="ilw1706080258166__section_cyt_rxb_f1c"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The ordinance applies to any employer with at least one employee in the District of

            or hourly pay in all job listings and position descriptions advertised.</p>

         <p class="p">In stating the minimum and maximum salary or hourly pay for the position, the employer
            must extend the range from the lowest to the highest salary or hourly pay that they in
            good faith believes at the time of the posting they would pay for the advertised job,
            promotion, or transfer opportunity.</p>

         <p class="p">Before the first interview, employers must also disclose to prospective employees the
            existence of healthcare benefits available to the employee.</p>

         <p class="p">The ordinance also prohibits employers from:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="ilw1706080258166__ul_lq3_txb_f1c">
            <li><span class="li">Screening prospective employees based on their wage history, including by requiring
               that a prospective employee's wage history satisfy minimum or maximum criteria or by
               requesting or requiring as a condition of being interviewed or as a condition of
               continuing to be considered for an offer of employment that a prospective employee
               disclose their wage history; or </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Employers must post a notice in the workplace notifying employees of their rights under
            the District's Wage Transparency law as amended by the ordinance. The notice must be
            posted in a conspicuous place in at least one location where employees congregate.</p>
