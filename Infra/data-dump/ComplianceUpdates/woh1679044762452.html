      <p class="p">The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published Publication 503 for use in preparing 2022 tax returns, which describes the tests a taxpayer must meet in order to claim the credit for child and dependent care expenses and explains how to calculate and claim the credit.</p>

      <section class="section" id="woh1679044762452__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2><p class="p">Under the <span class="q">“What's New”</span> Section, the 2022 Publication 503 states as follows:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">The 2021 enhancements to the credit for child and dependent care
               expenses have expired.</span> The changes to the credit for child and dependent care
            expenses for 2021 under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 have expired. For 2022, the
            credit for child and dependent care expenses is nonrefundable and you may claim the
            credit on qualifying employment-related expenses of up to $3,000 if you had one
            qualifying person, or $6,000 if you had two or more qualifying persons. The maximum
            credit is 35% of your employment-related expenses. The more you earn the lower the
            percentage of employment-related expenses that are considered in determining the credit.
            Once your adjusted gross income is over $43,000, the maximum credit is 20% of your
            employment-related expenses.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">The 2021 enhancements to dependent care benefits have expired.</span> The
            changes to dependent care benefits under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 have
            expired. For 2022, the maximum amount that can be excluded from an employee's income
            through a dependent care assistance program is $5,000 ($2,500 if married filing
            separately). Dependent care benefits are reported on Form 2441, line 12.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Temporary special rules for dependent care flexible spending
               arrangements (FSAs).</span> Section 214 of the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax
            Relief Act of 2020 provides temporary COVID-19 relief for dependent care FSAs. This
            legislation allows employers to amend their dependent care plan to allow unused amounts
            to be used in a subsequent year. Unused amounts from 2020 and/or 2021 are added to the
            maximum amount of dependent care benefits that are allowed for 2022.</p>
