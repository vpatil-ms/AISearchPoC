         <p class="p">By way of background, Maryland enacted legislation, Senate Bill 275, in
            2022. Under the law, employees will be entitled to job protection and wage-replacement
            benefits if they need time off from work for certain family and medical reasons. The
            wage-replacement benefits will be funded by a payroll tax paid by covered employees and
            employers with 15 or more employees.</p>

         <p class="p">Senate Bill 828 makes changes to the timeline for implementing the
            program and amends and clarifies other aspects of the law.</p>

                           with paid vacation, paid sick leave or other paid time off so they
