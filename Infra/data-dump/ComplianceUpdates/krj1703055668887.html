      <p class="p">New York has enacted legislation (Senate Bill S5026: The Freelance Isn't Free Act, or <span class="q">“the Act”</span>), requiring businesses in New York state to enter into written agreements with certain independent contractors. Senate Bill S5206 takes effect on May 20, 2024.</p>

      <section class="section" id="krj1703055668887__section_vlm_vxg_vzb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The Act will require businesses in New York state to enter into a written agreement with
            a freelancer (independent contractor).</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Covered Employers</p>

         <p class="p">The law defines a hiring party as a person who retains a freelance worker to provide a
            service (except federal, state, local or foreign government entities).</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Covered Workers</p>

         <p class="p">The law defines a freelancer as a person or organization of no more than one natural
            person who a hiring party hired or retained as an independent contractor (freelancer) to
            provide services in exchange for an amount equal to or greater than $800 (either by
            itself or when combined with every contract for services between the same hiring party
            and freelancer during the preceding 120 days).</p>

         <div class="note note" id="krj1703055668887__note_fdy_2yg_vzb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The Act does not apply to services provided by attorneys, <a class="xref" href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S5026" target="_blank">construction contractors</a>, licensed medical professionals or <a class="xref" href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/LAB/191" target="_blank">sales representatives</a>.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Written Agreement Requirements</p>

         <p class="p">Under the law, an employer must furnish the freelancer with a physical or electronic
            copy of the required written agreement. The written agreement must include the
            following:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="krj1703055668887__ul_cxz_hyg_vzb">
            <li><span class="li">The name and mailing address of the hiring party and the freelancer; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An itemization of all services (and their value) to be provided; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The rate and method of compensation; </span></li>

         </ul>

         <div class="note note" id="krj1703055668887__note_dxz_hyg_vzb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Once a freelancer begins working, a hiring party cannot require a freelancer to
               accept less compensation than was specified in the written agreement.</p>

         </div>

         <ul class="ul" id="krj1703055668887__ul_exz_hyg_vzb">
            <li><span class="li">The date: <ul class="ul" id="krj1703055668887__ul_fxz_hyg_vzb">
                  <li><span class="li">A freelancer must be paid (or the mechanism that will determine payment
                     dates); and </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">By which a freelancer must submit a list of services rendered (invoices) to
                     meet internal processing deadlines for timely compensation by the payment date.
                  </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>

         <div class="note note" id="krj1703055668887__note_gxz_hyg_vzb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>If a payment date is not specified, a freelancer must be paid no later than 30 days
               after they complete their contracted services.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Nonretaliation</p>

         <p class="p">Under the law, employers may not threaten, intimidate, discipline, harass or
            discriminate against a freelancer, deny a work opportunity to a freelancer, or take any
            other action that penalizes a freelancer for exercising their rights under the law.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Recordkeeping</p>

         <p class="p">A hiring party must provide a copy of the written agreement to the freelancer and keep a
            copy of the agreement for six years.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="krj1703055668887__note_k4q_jyg_vzb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>If a dispute arises and a hiring party cannot present the written agreement, the
               freelancer's terms will be used.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Enforcement</p>

         <p class="p">Freelancers have six years to file a complaint with the Commissioner of Labor or in
            court and may be entitled to the amounts owed for services provided to the hiring party
            and other penalties.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers may face fines of up to $25,000, provided there is reasonable cause to believe
            that the hiring party engaged in a pattern or practice of violating the Act.</p>
