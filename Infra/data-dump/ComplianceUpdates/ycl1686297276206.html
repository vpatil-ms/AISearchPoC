      <p class="p">Kentucky has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 47) that will allow adults to use medicinal cannabis for certain medical conditions beginning in 2025. The law also addresses employers' rights regarding medicinal cannabis.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ycl1686297276206__section_g2f_yd1_txb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Beginning January 1, 2025, adults who obtain a state registration card will be able to
            use medicinal cannabis for certain medical conditions.</p>

         <p class="p">The law doesn't:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="ycl1686297276206__ul_kzv_zd1_txb">
            <li><span class="li">Require an employer to permit or accommodate the use, consumption or possession in
               the workplace. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prohibit an employer from implementing policies promoting workplace health and
               safety by: <ul class="ul" id="ycl1686297276206__ul_lzv_zd1_txb">
                  <li><span class="li">Restricting the use of medicinal cannabis by employees; or </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Restricting or prohibiting the use of equipment, machinery or power tools by
                     an employee who is a registered qualified patient, if the employer believes
                     that such use by an employee who is a registered qualified patient poses an
                     unreasonable safety risk; </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prohibit an employer from including contract provisions that prohibit the use of
               medicinal cannabis by employees; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Permit a cause of action against an employer for wrongful discharge or
               discrimination under the medicinal cannabis law itself; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prohibit an employer from establishing and enforcing a drug testing policy,
               drug-free workplace, or zero-tolerance drug policy; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prohibit an employer from exercising their ability to determine impairment of an
               employee who is a cardholder. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Good-faith determinations of impairment permitted under the law include behavioral
            assessments of impairment and a secondary step of testing an employee who is a
            cardholder for the presence of cannabis. Under the law, considering a registered
            cardholder under the influence of cannabis solely because of the presence of
            tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites is prohibited.</p>

         <p class="p">If an employer determines that an employee who is a cardholder is impaired by the use of
            cannabis from the behavioral assessment and testing, the burden of proving
            non-impairment then shifts to the employee to refute the findings of the employer.</p>

         <p class="p">An employee who is discharged from employment for consuming medicinal cannabis in the
            workplace, working while under the influence of medicinal cannabis, or testing positive
            for a controlled substance is ineligible to receive unemployment benefits if such
            actions are in violation of an employment contract or established personnel policy.</p>

         <p class="p">Kentucky employers should review policies and procedures to determine if changes should
            be made in light of Senate Bill 47.</p>
