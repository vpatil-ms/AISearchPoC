      <section class="section" id="evx1672211772276__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">In March 2020, New Jersey enacted SB 2304 to expand its earned sick leave, family leave act, and temporary disability insurance rules during a state of emergency in order to cover absences related to epidemics such as COVID-19.</p>

      <section class="section" id="evx1672211772276__section_N10052_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Senate Bill 2374:</h2><p class="p">Senate Bill 2374 further expands on the NJFLA and TDI program as follows:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">NJFLA Amendments:</span></p>
<p class="p">Senate Bill 2374 amends the NJFLA to allow employees to use family leave in the event of a state of emergency or an order by the Governor or public health authorities that results in:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">In-home care or treatment of a child whose school or place of care has been closed; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Mandatory quarantine because the presence in the community of a family member with known or suspected exposure would jeopardize the health of others; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The recommendation of a health care provider or public health authority that a family member voluntarily undergo self-quarantine as a result of known or suspected exposure. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Certification:</span></p>
<p class="p">The employer may request certification from the employee seeking leave for the above reasons, including:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The date and reason of closure (for their child's school or place of care closing) </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Date and anticipated length of the order (for a family member's mandatory quarantine) </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The date and probable length of recommended quarantine and medical or other facts that prompted the recommendation (for the family member's voluntary self-quarantine) </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Intermittent Leave:</span></p>
<p class="p">The amendments allow a covered employee to use NJFLA for the above reasons intermittently, provided the employee gives advance notice and attempts to schedule the intermittent leave in a way that does not disrupt normal business operations. Additionally, if possible, the employee should provide the employer with a regular schedule of the day or days of the week on which the intermittent leave will be taken.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">TDI Amendments:</span></p>
<p class="p">Senate Bill 2374 makes temporary disability and family temporary disability funds available to employees who take leave for pandemic-related reasons (covered above). The amendment also eliminates the seven-day waiting periods for benefits related to the above reasons.</p>
