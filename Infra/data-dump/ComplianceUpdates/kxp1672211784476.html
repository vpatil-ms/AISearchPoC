      <p class="p">Illinois has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 1480) that restricts the use of conviction records for employment purposes. Senate Bill 1480 took effect immediately.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kxp1672211784476__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Restrictions:</h2><p class="p">Under the law, employers are generally prohibited from using a conviction record for employment purposes unless:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">There is a substantial relationship between one or more of the previous criminal offenses and the employment sought or held; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employment would involve an unreasonable risk to property or to the safety or welfare of specific individuals or the general public. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The law defines <span class="q">“substantial relationship”</span> to mean a consideration of whether the employment position offers the opportunity for the same or a similar offense to occur and whether the circumstances leading to the conduct for which the person was convicted will recur in the employment position.</p>
<p class="p">Additionally, before making a decision to bar employment, an employer must assess the risk that the employee poses to the workplace in the particular position and determine whether the risk is unreasonable under the circumstances, according to the Illinois Department of Human Rights.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kxp1672211784476__section_N10067_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Factors to Consider:</h2><p class="p">In making a determination about whether a substantial relationship or unreasonable risk exists, the employer must consider the following factors:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The length of time since the conviction; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The number of convictions that appear on the record; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The nature and severity of the conviction and its relationship to the safety and security of others; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The facts or circumstances surrounding the conviction; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The age of the employee at the time of the conviction; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Evidence of rehabilitation efforts. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="kxp1672211784476__section_N1008C_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Preliminary Decision Notice:</h2><p class="p">If, after considering the above factors, the employer makes a preliminary decision that the employee's conviction record disqualifies them, the employer must notify the employee of the decision in writing. The notification must contain all of the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Notice of the disqualifying conviction(s) that are the basis for the preliminary decision and the reasoning for the disqualification; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A copy of the conviction history report, if any; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An explanation of the employee's right to respond to the notice before that decision becomes final. The explanation must inform the employee that the response may include, but isn't limited to, submission of evidence challenging the accuracy of the conviction record that is the basis for the disqualification, or evidence in mitigation, such as rehabilitation. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The employee must be given at least five business days to respond to the notification. The employer must consider information submitted by the employee before making a final decision.</p>

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A notice of the disqualifying conviction(s) that are the basis for the final decision and the reasoning for the disqualification; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Any existing procedure the employer has for the employee to challenge the decision or request reconsideration; and </span></li>
