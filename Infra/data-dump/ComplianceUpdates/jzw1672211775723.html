      <p class="p">A federal district court judge in New York has struck down key regulations implementing the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA).</p>

      <section class="section" id="jzw1672211775723__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The <a class="xref" href="https://sbshrs.adpinfo.com/covid19-stimulus-package" target="_blank">FFCRA</a> requires employers with fewer than 500 employees to provide paid leave to employees who are unable to work or telework because of certain COVID-related reasons. The law requires two types of paid leave: Emergency Paid Sick Leave and Public Health Emergency Leave. Under the law, an employer of a healthcare provider or an emergency responder may elect to exclude the employee from the leave requirements. The law went into effect on April 1, 2020 and expires on December 31, 2020.</p>
<p class="p">On April 1, 2020, the Department of Labor (DOL) issued regulations that defined key terms and made important clarifications to the law, including the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Work-Availability Requirement:</span> Entitled
               employees to FFCRA leave <span class="ph em">only if</span> there was work available
               to them. For instance, if the employer sends employees home and stops paying them
               because of a lack of work, the employee wouldn't be eligible for FFCRA leave under
               the regulations;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Definition of Healthcare Provider:</span>
               Defined healthcare provider as anyone employed at any doctor's office, hospital,
               health care center, clinic, postsecondary educational institution offering health
               care instruction, medical school, local health department or agency, nursing
               facility, retirement facility, nursing home, home health care provider, any facility
               that performs laboratory or medical testing, pharmacy, or any similar institution,
               employer, or entity;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Intermittent Leave:</span> Allowed employees
               to take leave intermittently for certain qualifying reasons but <span class="ph em">only if</span> the employer agrees to it;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Documentation:</span> Required that prior to
               taking FFCRA leave, employees must submit certain documentation to the employer. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Shortly after the regulations were issued, the attorney general for the state of New York filed a lawsuit challenging each of the four provisions above, arguing that they unduly restrict FFCRA leave.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Work-Availability Requirement:</span></p>

         <p class="p">On August 3, 2020, a federal district court judge in New York struck
            down the regulations' work-availability requirement, finding that the explanation the
            DOL provided in the regulations for the requirement is insufficient.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Definition of Healthcare Provider:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The judge also struck down the regulations' definition of healthcare
            provider as overly broad because it hinges entirely on the identity of the employer and
            includes employees whose roles have no connection with providing healthcare services.
            For instance, an English professor, librarian, or cafeteria manager at a university with
            a medical school could all be considered <span class="q">“healthcare providers”</span>
            under the definition.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Intermittent Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The judge ruled that the DOL was within its authority to limit
            intermittent leave to certain qualifying reasons. However, the judge struck down the
            part of the provision that required employer consent for employees to take the leave
            intermittently.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Documentation:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The judge struck down the requirement that documentation be provided
            prior to the employee taking the leave.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Remaining Regulations Not Impacted:</span></p>

         <p class="p">All other provisions of the FFCRA regulations stand.</p>

      </section>

      <section class="section" id="jzw1672211775723__section_N1009B_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">The judge's ruling creates confusion about how to apply the rules for paid leave under the FFCRA. For instance, it's unclear whether the ruling applies to just employers in the Southern District of New York (the counties of New York, Bronx, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Dutchess, and Sullivan) or employers nationally or how employers should handle leave that was previously denied based on the struck-down regulations. The ruling itself doesn't address these issues, and the DOL hasn't responded to the ruling yet. All employers should monitor the situation closely and discuss the implications of the ruling with their legal counsel.</p>
