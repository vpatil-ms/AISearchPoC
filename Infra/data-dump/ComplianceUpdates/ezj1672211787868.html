      <p class="p">Massachusetts has enacted legislation that extends and expands a requirement that all employers provide COVID-19 emergency paid sick leave. Employers that provide the leave may request reimbursement from the state's COVID-19 Emergency Paid Sick Leave Fund. The leave requirement will expire when the $75 million fund is exhausted or April 1, 2022, whichever occurs first. The requirement was set to end on September 30, 2021 but has just been extended by House Bill 4127. Employees may also now use leave to care for a family member who obtains the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ezj1672211787868__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Use of Leave:</h2><p class="p">Employees may use COVID-19 emergency paid sick leave for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">To self-isolate and care for themselves because of the employee's COVID-19 diagnosis; get a medical diagnosis, care, or treatment for COVID-19 symptoms; or obtain or recover from the COVID-19 vaccine. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To care for a family member who is self-isolating due to a COVID-19 diagnosis or needs medical diagnosis, care or treatment for COVID-19 symptoms. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If they or a family member are subject to a quarantine order, or other determination by a local, state, or federal public official, a health authority having jurisdiction, their employer, or a healthcare provider. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Their inability to telework because the employee has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and the employee's symptoms inhibit the ability to telework. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Effective October 1, 2021, the leave may also be used to care for a family member who is obtaining the COVID-19 vaccine or recovering from an injury, disability, illness, or condition related to such immunization.</p>
<p class="p">A family member is defined as the employee's spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent, including a spouse's or domestic partner's parent; a person who stood in place of a parent to the employee when the employee was a minor child; and a grandchild, grandparent or sibling of the employee.</p>
<p class="p">An employee may use COVID-19 emergency paid sick leave on an intermittent basis and in hourly increments.</p>
