      <p class="p">New Mexico has enacted legislation (House Bill 20), also known as the
         Healthy Workplaces Act (<span class="q">“the Act”</span>), that requires employers to provide
         paid sick and safe leave to employees. The Act takes effect on <span class="ph strong">July 1, 2022</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="mfd1672211785680__section_N1004C_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Accrual:</h2><p class="p">Employees must accrue at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to 64 hours per year. Alternatively, employers may elect to frontload all 64 hours at the beginning of each year. Employees may use any accrued leave in the smallest increment allowed by the employer's payroll system, or hourly, whichever is smaller.</p>
<p class="p">Employees who are exempt from overtime are assumed to work 40 hours per workweek for the purposes of earned sick leave accrual, unless their normal workweek is less than 40 hours. In such cases, sick leave accrues based on their normal workweek.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="mfd1672211785680__section_N10059_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Carryover:</h2><p class="p">Unused leave may carry over into the following year, but employers are not required to allow employees to use more than 64 hours in a 12-month period. The Act does not require employers to pay out unused leave at the time of termination, however unused leave must be reinstated when an employee is rehired within 12 months.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="mfd1672211785680__section_N10063_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">12-Month Period:</h2><p class="p">An employer may choose any one of the following methods for determining the 12-month period in which earned sick leave may be used:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The calendar year; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Any fixed 12-month leave year, such as a fiscal year, a year required by other law or a year starting on an employee's anniversary date; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The 12-month period measured forward from the date an employee first uses earned sick leave; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A rolling 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any earned sick leave. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="mfd1672211785680__section_N10080_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Use:</h2><p class="p">The Act allows employees to use the leave for:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The diagnosis, care, or treatment of, or recovery from mental or physical illness, injury or other adverse health condition, or for preventive medical care for themselves or a family member; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Meetings at their child's school or place of care related to the child's health or disability; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Reasons related to domestic abuse, sexual assault, or stalking, including the need to obtain services, relocate, obtain medical or psychological treatment or counseling, or prepare for or participate in legal proceedings. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The law prohibits employers from requiring employees to use other types of paid leave before they use leave under the Act.</p>

      <section class="section" id="mfd1672211785680__section_N1009C_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employee Notice and Documentation:</h2><p class="p">Employers may require employees to provide as much advance notice as practical, and when possible, the expected duration of their absence. Employers may also require employees to make a reasonable effort to schedule their leave so it does not unduly disrupt business operations.</p>
<p class="p">Employers are prohibited from requiring an employee, as a condition for using leave, to search for or find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which an employee is using their leave.</p>
<p class="p">For leave lasting two or more consecutive days, employers may require reasonable documentation
            that the leave is being taken for a covered purpose. For examples of reasonable
            documentation, see the <a class="xref" href="https://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/21%20Regular/final/HB0020.pdf" target="_blank">full text</a> of the law. All information an employer obtains
            related to an employee's reasons for taking sick leave must be treated as a confidential
            medical record.</p>

      <section class="section" id="mfd1672211785680__section_N100B3_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Pay:</h2><p class="p">Earned sick time must be compensated at the employee's same hourly rate, with the same benefits (including health care benefits), as an employee would normally earn for hours worked.</p>

      <section class="section" id="mfd1672211785680__section_N100BD_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employer Notice Requirements:</h2><p class="p">Employers must provide paid sick leave information to employees, in written or electronic form, at the start of their employment that explains:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Employees have a right to leave; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">How leave is accrued and calculated; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The terms under which an employee may use leave; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">That employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees for using leave; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employees have the right to file a complaint if they're denied leave or retaliated against; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The means for enforcing violations of the Act. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">In each establishment, employers must display a poster in a conspicuous and accessible place that contains the above information. The poster must be in English, Spanish, or any language that is the first language spoken by at least 10% of the employer's workforce. The state will create a model notice that employers may use for this purpose.</p>
