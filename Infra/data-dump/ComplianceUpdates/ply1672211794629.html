      <p class="p">The California Department of Industrial Relations has announced an increase
         to the pay rates that computer software employees and physicians must receive in order to
         be exempt from overtime. Additionally, the minimum salary required for the administrative,
         professional, and executive overtime exemptions will also increase. These new rates take
         effect on <span class="ph strong">January 1, 2022</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ply1672211794629__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Computer software employees and physicians:</span></p>
<p class="p">Under the California Labor Code, <a class="xref" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;sectionNum=515.5." target="_blank">computer software employees</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;sectionNum=515.6." target="_blank">physicians</a> are exempt from the state's overtime requirements if they meet specific duties requirements and earn a minimum pay rate. These pay thresholds are adjusted annually for inflation.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Administrative, executive, and professional
               employees:</span></p>
<p class="p">California also has exemptions for bona fide administrative, professional, and executive employees. To be exempt from overtime, these employees must meet certain state salary and duties tests. They must be paid a salary of at least twice the state minimum hourly wage based on full-time employment of 40 hours per week. Since the state's minimum hourly wage will increase on January 1, 2022, the minimum salary thresholds for these exemptions will also increase.</p>
