      <p class="p">Texas has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 7) that bans certain COVID-19 vaccine mandates. Senate Bill 7 takes effect on February 6, 2024.</p>

      <section class="section" id="eub1702546997676__section_xq2_d3p_tzb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The law prohibits a private employer from adopting or enforcing a mandate that requires
            an employee, contractor or applicant to be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a condition of
            employment or a contract position.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="eub1702546997676__note_oyn_d3p_tzb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The law applies to employer actions that occur on or after February 6, 2024.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Exceptions</p>

         <p class="p">Under Senate Bill 7, healthcare facilities and providers may establish and enforce a
            policy to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. The policy may include requiring an
            individual who is an employee or contractor of the facility, or a provider or physician,
            that is not vaccinated against COVID-19 to use protective medical equipment (based on
            the level of risk the individual presents to patients from their routine and direct
            exposure to patients).</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Nonretaliation</p>

         <p class="p">The law prohibits an employer from taking an adverse action that would punish, alienate,
            or otherwise adversely affect an employee, contractor, or applicant for refusing to be
            vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Enforcement</p>

         <p class="p">Employers that are found to have violated the law may be fined $50,000 per violation,
            unless the employer:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="eub1702546997676__ul_d4t_w3p_tzb">
            <li><span class="li">Hires the applicant for employment or the contract position; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Reinstates the employee or contractor and provides them with back pay from the date
               of the adverse action and makes every reasonable effort to reverse the effects of the
               adverse action. This includes reestablishing employee benefits that the employee or
               contractor would have been eligible for, if the adverse action had not been taken.
            </span></li>

         </ul>
