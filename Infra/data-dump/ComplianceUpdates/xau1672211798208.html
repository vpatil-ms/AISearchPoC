The Ordinance was to take effect 90 days after the county made employer-notice material available through its <a class="xref" href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/work/index.aspx" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xau1672211798208__section_N10055_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Update:
            Allegheny County has posted its paid sick leave ordinance, </h2><a class="xref" href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/uploadedFiles/Allegheny_Home/Dept_-_Content/Administrative/Docs/Paid%20Sick%20Leave%20Ordinance%20-%20notice.pdf" target="_blank">notice</a>, <a class="xref" href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/uploadedFiles/Allegheny_Home/Dept_-_Content/Administrative/Docs/Paid%20Sick%20Leave%20-%20Guidelines.pdf" target="_blank">guidelines</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/administrative/paid-sick-leave-faqs.aspx" target="_blank">FAQs</a> to its website. Although the Ordinance
         required employers' notice obligations to begin immediately once the law was approved, and
         for the other provisions of the ordinance to take effect 90 calendar days after the notice
         was posted, the County has changed the effective date of all parts of the ordinance to be
         December 15, 2021.<div class="note note" id="xau1672211798208__note_N10070_N10055_N10041_N10001"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The Ordinance is silent on its interplay with the Pittsburgh Paid
               Sick Days Act, which went into effect in March 2020 and provides paid sick leave to
               eligible employees who work in the City of Pittsburgh, which is located in Allegheny
               County. Further guidance on this issue is anticipated.</p>
