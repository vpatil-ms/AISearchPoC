      <p class="p">Pursuant to Senate Bill 2353, amendments to New Jersey's mini-WARN Act (the <span class="q">“Act”</span>) that were scheduled to take effect on July 19, 2020 will now take effect 90 days after the conclusion of the COVID-19 public health emergency as declared by the Governor's Executive Order 103 of 2020.</p>

      <p class="p"><span class="ph em">Senate Bill 2353 also clarifies that closings due to fires, floods,
            natural disasters, acts of war, national emergencies, civil disorder, or industrial
            sabotage, are excluded from the Act's definition of mass layoff. Mass layoffs related to
            COVID-19 are also excluded from the law's severance requirements. Senate Bill 2353 is
            effective immediately and retroactive to March 9, 2020.</span></p>

      <section class="section" id="bqp1672211768991__section_N10053_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The NJ mini-WARN Act requires covered employers to provide 60 days advance notice for mass
            layoffs or an impending termination or transfer of operations. A covered employer is an
            employer that has been in operation in the State of New Jersey for more than three years
            and employs 100 or more <span class="ph em">full-time</span> employees.</p>

      <section class="section" id="bqp1672211768991__section_N10062_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Senate Bill 3170:</h2><p class="p">Senate Bill 3170 amends the New Jersey mini-WARN Act as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Covers smaller employers:</span> As amended, the Act applies
               to any reduction in force within a 30-day period that results in the termination of
               50 or more (full-time or part-time) employees (regardless of their length of service)
               at any of the employer's locations within the state. This applies to locations that
               have been in operation for at least three years. Previously, the Act applied to
               layoffs of 500 or more full-time employees or to 50 or more full-time employees
               representing at least one-third of the employees at a single site.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Notification period extended:</span> Employers must now
               provide 90 days advance notice, instead of 60 days.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Severance pay required:</span> Employers must provide
               impacted employees with one week of severance pay for each year of employment.
               Employees who fail to receive notice within 90 days are entitled to an additional
               four weeks of severance pay. Severance pay includes backpay and losses associated
               with termination, and must be paid in full upon termination.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Changes in control:</span> Employers must provide employees
               with 15 days advance notice before a change in control. Additionally, successor
               employers must retain, for at least 180 days, all employees who have been employed by
               their employer for at least 90 days immediately before the change of control.
               Successor employers are also prohibited from reducing the employees' pay. </span></li>
