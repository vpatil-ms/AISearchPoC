                           covered employee is defined as one who works at least 80 hours for an
                           employer within any 120-day period while physically present within the
                           geographic boundaries of the city. Once the threshold is reached, the
                           employee will remain a covered employee for the remainder of the time
                           that the employee works for the employer. Any compensable time an

However, the state law doesn't apply to any employer that is covered by a municipal or county ordinance that is in effect on January 1, 2024 that requires employers to give any form of paid leave to their employees.</p>
<p class="p">As a result, it currently appears that with respect to:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="erd1704264096144__ul_v2c_3p2_b1c">
            <li><span class="li">Employees working outside of Cook County – Covered employers must comply with the
               Illinois Paid Leave for All Workers Act.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employees working in Cook County but outside of Chicago – Covered employers must
               comply with the Cook County Paid Leave ordinance. Assuming that the municipality
               where the employee works does not <span class="q">“opt-out”</span> of the Cook County Paid Leave
               Ordinance, then the employer would not need to comply with the Illinois Paid Leave
               for All Workers Act.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employees working in Chicago – Covered employers must comply with the Chicago Paid
               Leave and Paid Sick and Safe Leave Ordinance and do not need to comply with the
               Illinois Paid Leave for All Workers Act.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The Cook County Paid leave ordinance does not address whether it applies to municipalities that have enacted their own paid leave laws (ex. Chicago). The county is expected to issue additional guidance on the ordinance by January 1, 2024 and this issue may be addressed in that guidance.</p>
<p class="p">In the interim, there are many nuances and a significant degree of uncertainty. You may wish to consult with legal counsel to ensure compliance based on the information and guidance presently available.</p>
