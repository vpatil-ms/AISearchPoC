      <p class="p">The minimum wage in Michigan will increase to $9.87 per hour on January 1, 2022, unless unemployment in the state increases dramatically during the remainder of 2021.</p>

      <section class="section" id="njg1672211794194__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">In 2018, Michigan's legislature enacted legislation that increases the minimum wage in several steps. However, the law delays any increase if the annual unemployment in the state is 8.5 percent or higher. Due to a pandemic-related increase in unemployment in 2020, the increase scheduled for 2021 was pushed back a year.</p>

The state would have to see a significant increase in unemployment in the final months of the year to raise the annual average to 8.5 percent or above and delay the minimum wage increase set for January 1, 2022.</p>

      <section class="section" id="njg1672211794194__section_N1005C_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">Michigan employers should be prepared to pay all non-exempt employees at least $9.87 per hour
            beginning January 1, 2022 but should watch for updates in the unlikely event that the
            average unemployment rate for the year meets the threshold for a delay. Employers should
            also be prepared to post an up-to-date minimum wage notice in the workplace. Once
            published by the state, the poster will be available for download from the State &amp;
            Federal Resources section of HR411<sup>®</sup>.</p>
