      <p class="p">The Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry has adopted a final rule addressing tipped employees and calculating overtime pay for salaried nonexempt employees. The final rule takes effect on August 5, 2022.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kta1679044749223__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2>
         
         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) Tipped
               Employees:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Under the FLSA, a tipped employee is an employee engaged in an operation
            in which they customarily and regularly receive more than $30 a month in tips. Tip
            pooling is allowed among employees that customarily and regularly receive tips; and tips
            are the property of the employee.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">FLSA Non- Exempt Salaried Employees:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) allows employers to use the <a class="xref" href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/82-bonus-rule" target="_blank">fluctuating workweek</a> (FWW) method to determine
            a non-exempt salaried employee's regular rate of pay. This method pays an employee a
            flat weekly salary regardless of the regular hours they work in a week (which can vary
            by week). Under the FWW, overtime pay is based on the average hourly rate produced by
            dividing the employee's fixed salary and any non-excludable additional pay (e.g.,
            commissions, bonuses, or hazard pay) by the number of hours actually worked in a
            specific workweek. For each hour worked that exceeds 40 in a week, the employee receives
            at least an additional 0.5 times (or additional <span class="q">“half time”</span>) that
            rate for each hour worked beyond 40 in the workweek.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="kta1679044749223__note_N1005D_N10040_N10039_N10001"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The fluctuating workweek method cannot be used if the employee's
               salary is understood to be compensation for a specific, fixed number of hours per
               workweek.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Pennsylvania Tipped Employees:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Pennsylvania employers generally must pay employees a minimum wage of at
            least $7.25 per hour, but special provisions exist for tipped employees:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">An employer must pay a minimum cash wage of $2.83 to tipped
               employees. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers may take a tip credit of $4.42 as long as the tips
               received by the employee and cash wage of $2.83 equal at least $7.25 per hour. </span></li>

         </ul>

      </section>

      <section class="section" id="kta1679044749223__section_N10075_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Pennsylvania Final Rule for Tipped
               Employees:</span></p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Definition of Tipped Employee:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The final rule increases the tipped employee threshold to $135 per month
            from the FLSA threshold of $30 per month. Consequently, as of August 5, 2022, a
            Pennsylvania employer may only take the tip credit of $4.42 per hour if an employee
            receives over $135 in tips in a month.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Service Charges:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Under the final rule, an employer may distribute a collected service
            charge to its employees, but the amounts distributed to employees must count as
            remuneration relating to the employees' regular rates of pay; it may not count as a
            tip.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Tip Pooling:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The final rule aligns with the DOL's tip pooling rules in that:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="kta1679044749223__ul_rnl_m4j_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">An employer that requires a tipped employee to perform work that is
               not part of the worker's tipped occupation may not take a tip credit for that time;
               and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Work that is performed is not part of a tipped occupation if it does
               not: <ul class="ul" id="kta1679044749223__ul_snl_m4j_wwb">
                  <li><span class="li">Provide service to customers for which a tipped employee
                     receives tips; and </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Directly support tip-producing work. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The final rule also restricts tip pools to those who perform tipped
            work. A tip pool that includes non-managerial workers who perform non-tipped work must
            pay $7.25 per hour.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Notice Requirements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">An employer must provide written notice to affected employees in a tip
            pooling arrangement:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="kta1679044749223__ul_tnl_m4j_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">At or before the time they make an employment offer, or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">At least one pay period before the tip pooling arrangement takes
               effect. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Recordkeeping:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers with tip pooling arrangements must keep records of the
            employees who partake in the tip pool and the dates and amounts of tips disbursed to
            employees.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="kta1679044749223__note_h4l_m4j_wwb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employers should prepare to make these records available to the DOLI
               upon request.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Credit Card and Processing Fee
            Deductions:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The final rule also prohibits an employer that permits patrons to pay
            tips by credit card (and other non-cash payments) from deducting credit card payments or
            fees that are charged to the employer from an employee's tips or from a tipping
            pool.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Non-Tipped Duties:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Under the final rule, an employer may take a tip credit for the time a
            tipped employee performs work that directly supports but is not tip-producing work, so
            long as the time does not exceed:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="kta1679044749223__ul_i4l_m4j_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">30 continuous minutes; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">20% of the hours in the workweek that an employer has taken a tip
               credit. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The first 30 minutes of such continuous work may be compensated at a tip
            credit rate ($2.83 per hour), but employers must pay at least $7.25 per hour for any
            time over the 30 minutes.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kta1679044749223__section_N100FD_N10039_N10001"><div class="note note" id="kta1679044749223__note_N10101_N100FE_N10039_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The 20% limitation refers only to hours for which the employer has taken a tip credit.</p>
</div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Final Rule Pay Requirements for Non-Exempt
               Salaried Employees:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The final rule formally prohibits an employer from using the FWW method to calculate a
            salaried, non-exempt employee's overtime pay. The PA Supreme Court previously held that
            the FLSA's fluctuating workweek pay method does not apply under Pennsylvania law.</p>

         <p class="p">Consequently, when determining the regular rate of pay for non-exempt salaried
            employees, an employer will divide the total non-excludable compensation for the week
            and divide by 40 rather than divide by the total number of hours worked in the week.</p>
