      <p class="p">Utah has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 2004) that adds a COVID-19 vaccination exemption process and requires employers to pay for testing. Senate Bill 2004 is effective immediately.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Vaccination Exemption Process:</h2><p class="p">Utah employers who require an employee or candidate to receive, or provide proof of, COVID-19 vaccination as a condition of employment must provide an exemption to the requirement if the individual submits a statement that receiving the vaccine would:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Harm their health and well-being; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Conflict with a sincerely held personal or religious belief, practice, or observance. </span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Exempt Employers:</h2><p class="p">Federal contractors; certain individuals subject to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' COVID-19 vaccine regulations, and employers with fewer than 15 employees who can establish a nexus between the requirement and the employee's assigned duties are not covered by the exemption requirement.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">COVID-19 Testing Costs:</h2><p class="p">Senate Bill 2004 also requires employers to cover all costs of COVID-19 testing that relate to, or are required for, the employee's presence at the workplace.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Recordkeeping Requirements:</h2><p class="p">Employers may record whether or not an employee is vaccinated, but employers generally may not maintain an employee's proof of vaccination, unless required by law or industry standards.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Non-Retaliation:</h2><p class="p">Senate Bill 2004 prohibits Utah employers from taking adverse action (such as refusing to hire, terminating, demoting, or reducing wages) against an employee who complies with the law, but employers may reassign or terminate an employee if reassignment is impractical.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">Utah employers should consult legal counsel to discuss the impact of the law on their vaccination policies and practices.</p>
