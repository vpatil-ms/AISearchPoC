      <p class="p">California has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 1044) that will prohibit,
         with limited exceptions, an employer from taking adverse action against an employee for
         refusing to report to, or leaving, work during emergency conditions. Senate Bill 1044 takes
         effect <span class="ph strong">January 1, 2023</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="egu1679044756714__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">In the event of an emergency condition, employers are prohibited from
            doing either of the following:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="egu1679044756714__ul_rtq_hxk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Taking or threatening adverse action against any employee for
               refusing to report to, or leaving, a workplace or worksite within the affected area
               because the employee has a reasonable belief that the workplace or worksite is
               unsafe. Certain types of workers, such as emergency responders, are exempt from this
               provision. See the <a class="xref" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1044&amp;showamends=false" target="_blank">text of the law</a> for details. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prevent any employee from accessing the employee's mobile device or
               other communications device for seeking emergency assistance, assessing the safety of
               the situation, or communicating with a person to verify their safety. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Covered Emergency Conditions:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Senate Bill 1044 defines an emergency condition as the existence of
            either of the following:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="egu1679044756714__ul_nfy_gxk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Conditions of disaster or extreme peril to the safety of persons or
               property at the workplace or worksite caused by natural forces or a criminal act. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An order to evacuate a workplace, a worksite, a worker's home, or
               the school of a worker's child due to natural disaster or a criminal act. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <div class="note note" id="egu1679044756714__note_ofy_gxk_wwb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>A health pandemic isn't an emergency condition under the law.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Reasonable Belief Defined:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The law establishes that <span class="q">“a reasonable belief that the
               workplace or worksite is unsafe”</span> means a reasonable person, under the
            circumstances known to the employee at the time, would conclude there is a real danger
            of death or serious injury if that person enters or remains on the premises. The
            existence of any health and safety regulations specific to the emergency condition and
            an employer's compliance or noncompliance with those regulations are a relevant factor
            if this information is known to the employee at the time of the emergency condition or
            the employee received training on the health and safety regulations mandated by law
            specific to the emergency condition.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employee Notice Required:</span></p>

         <p class="p">When feasible, an employee must notify the employer of the emergency
            condition requiring the employee to leave or refuse to report to the workplace or
            worksite prior to leaving or refusing to report.</p>

         <p class="p">When prior notice isn't feasible, the employee must notify the employer
            as soon as possible of the emergency condition that required the employee to leave or
            refuse to report to the workplace or worksite.</p>
