      <p class="p">The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has published a final rule that will change the test for determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The final rule takes effect March 11, 2024.</p>

      <section class="section" id="mov1706080257937__section_ihs_nyb_f1c"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p subHeading1">Background</p>

         <p class="p">The DOL uses an <span class="q">“<a class="xref" href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/13-flsa-employment-relationship" target="_blank">economic realities</a>”</span> test to determine whether workers
            are considered independent contractors or employees. Workers classified as employees are
            covered by the FLSA and entitled to minimum wage, overtime, and other wage and hour
            protections. Prior to 2021, this test looked at the following factors, each carrying
            equal weight:</p>

         <ol class="concept" id="mov1706080257937__ol_w2c_qyb_f1c">
            <li><span class="li">The worker's opportunities for profit and loss. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The amount of the worker's investment in facilities and equipment. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The permanency of the relationship. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The nature and degree of control by the principal. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The amount of initiative, judgment, or foresight in open market competition with
               others required for the worker's success. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The extent to which the services rendered are an integral part of the principal's
               business. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The degree of independent business organization and operation. </span></li>

         </ol>

         <p class="p subHeading1">2021 Rule</p>

         <p class="p">Toward the end of the Trump Administration, the DOL published a final rule (the 2021
            rule) that sharpened the economic realities test into five distinct factors,
            including:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="mov1706080257937__ul_cvk_syb_f1c">
            <li><span class="li">Two <span class="q">“core factors”</span> that carried more weight in the analysis. These two factors
               were the nature and degree of the worker's control over the work, and the worker's
               opportunity for profit or loss based on initiative and/or investment. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Three other factors served as additional guideposts in the analysis: the amount of
               skill required for the work; the degree of permanence of the working relationship
               between the worker and the potential employer; and whether the work is part of an
               integrated unit of production. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The Biden Administration tried to withdraw the 2021 rule, but a federal judge ultimately
            decided that the 2021 rule went into effect on March 8, 2021, as planned by the Trump
            Administration.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">2024 Final Rule</p>

         <p class="p">Effective March 11, 2024, the DOL's new final rule will rescind the 2021 rule and:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="mov1706080257937__ul_fxf_wyb_f1c">
            <li><span class="li">Return to a totality-of-the-circumstances economic reality test, where no single
               factor or group of factors is assigned any predetermined weight; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Consider six factors (instead of five), including the investments made by the worker
               and the potential employer; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide additional analysis of the control factor, including a detailed discussion
               of how scheduling, supervision, price-setting, and the ability to work for others
               should be considered when analyzing the nature and degree of control over a worker; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Return to the DOL's long-standing consideration of whether the work is integral to
               the employer's business (rather than whether it is exclusively part of an
                  <span class="q">“integrated unit of production”</span>); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide additional context to some factors, including a discussion of exclusivity in
               the context of the permanency factor and initiative in the context of the skill
               factor; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Omit a provision from the 2021 rule, which addressed the relevance of an employer's
               reserved but unexercised rights to control a worker. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">As a result of the changes, the economic realities test will look at the following
            factors beginning March 11, 2024:</p>

         <ol class="concept" id="mov1706080257937__ol_gxf_wyb_f1c">
            <li><span class="li">Opportunity for profit or loss depending on managerial skill. This factor considers
               whether the worker has opportunities for profit or loss based on managerial skill
               (including initiative or business acumen or judgment) that affect the worker's
               economic success or failure in performing the work.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"> The following facts, among others, can be relevant: whether the worker determines
               or can meaningfully negotiate the charge or pay for the work provided; whether the
               worker accepts or declines jobs or chooses the order and/or time in which the jobs
               are performed; whether the worker engages in marketing, advertising, or other efforts
               to expand their business or secure more work; and whether the worker makes decisions
               to hire others, purchase materials and equipment, and/or rent space. If a worker has
               no opportunity for a profit or loss, then this factor suggests that the worker is an
               employee. Some decisions by a worker that can affect the amount of pay that a worker
               receives, such as the decision to work more hours or take more jobs when paid a fixed
               rate per hour or per job, generally do not reflect the exercise of managerial skill
               indicating independent contractor status under this factor.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Investments by the worker and the employer. This factor considers whether any
               investments by a worker are capital or entrepreneurial in nature. Costs to a worker
               of tools and equipment to perform a specific job, costs of workers' labor, and costs
               that the potential employer imposes unilaterally on the worker, for example, are not
               evidence of capital or entrepreneurial investment and indicate employee status.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"> Investments that are capital or entrepreneurial in nature and thus indicate
               independent contractor status generally support an independent business and serve a
               business-like function, such as increasing the worker's ability to do different types
               of or more work, reducing costs, or extending market reach. Additionally, the
               worker's investments should be considered on a relative basis with the potential
               employer's investments in its overall business. The worker's investments do not have
               to be equal to the potential employer's investments and should not be compared only
               in terms of the dollar values of investments or the sizes of the worker and the
               potential employer. Instead, the focus should be on comparing the investments to
               determine whether the worker is making similar types of investments as the potential
               employer (even if on a smaller scale) to suggest that the worker is operating
               independently, which would indicate independent contractor status.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Degree of permanence of the work relationship. This factor weighs in favor of the
               worker being an employee when the work relationship is indefinite in duration,
               continuous, or exclusive of work for other employers. This factor weighs in favor of
               the worker being an independent contractor when the work relationship is definite in
               duration, non-exclusive, project-based, or sporadic based on the worker being in
               business for themself and marketing their services or labor to multiple entities.
               This may include regularly occurring fixed periods of work, although the seasonal or
               temporary nature of work by itself would not necessarily indicate independent
               contractor classification. Where a lack of permanence is due to operational
               characteristics that are unique or intrinsic to particular businesses or industries
               and the workers they employ, this factor is not necessarily indicative of independent
               contractor status unless the worker is exercising their own independent business
               initiative.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Nature and degree of control. This factor considers the potential employer's
               control, including reserved control, over the performance of the work and the
               economic aspects of the working relationship.</span></li>

         </ol>

         <p class="p">Facts relevant to the potential employer's control over the worker include whether the
            potential employer sets the worker's schedule, supervises the performance of the work,
            or explicitly limits the worker's ability to work for others. Additionally, facts
            relevant to the potential employer's control over the worker include whether the
            potential employer uses technological means to supervise the performance of the work
            (such as by means of a device or electronically), reserves the right to supervise or
            discipline workers, or places demands or restrictions on workers that do not allow them
            to work for others or work when they choose.</p>

         <p class="p">Whether the potential employer controls economic aspects of the working relationship
            should also be considered, including control over prices or rates for services and the
            marketing of the services or products provided by the worker.</p>

         <p class="p">Actions taken by the potential employer for the sole purpose of complying with a
            specific, applicable federal, state, tribal, or local law or regulation are not
            indicative of control. As examples of such compliance actions that are not indicative of
            control, the final rule identifies a publication's requirement that a writer comply with
            libel law and a home care agency's requirement that all individuals with patient contact
            undergo background checks in compliance with a specific Medicaid regulation. Actions
            taken by the potential employer that go beyond compliance with a specific, applicable
            federal, state, tribal, or local law or regulation and instead serve the potential
            employer's own compliance methods, safety, quality control, or contractual or customer
            service standards may be indicative of control. For example, a home care agency's
            imposition of extensive provider qualifications, such as fulfilling comprehensive
            training requirements (beyond training required for relevant licenses), may be probative
            of control. More control by the potential employer favors employee status; more control
            by the worker favors independent contractor status.</p>

         <ol class="concept" id="mov1706080257937__ol_hxf_wyb_f1c">
            <li><span class="li">Extent to which the work performed is an integral part of the employer's business.
               This factor considers whether the work performed is an integral part of the potential
               employer's business. This factor does not depend on whether any individual worker in
               particular is an integral part of the business, but rather whether the function they
               perform is an integral part of the business. This factor weighs in favor of the
               worker being an employee when the work they perform is critical, necessary, or
               central to the potential employer's principal business. This factor weighs in favor
               of the worker being an independent contractor when the work they perform is not
               critical, necessary, or central to the potential employer's principal business.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Skill and initiative. This factor considers whether the worker uses specialized
               skills to perform the work and whether those skills contribute to business-like
               initiative. This factor indicates employee status where the worker does not use
               specialized skills in performing the work or where the worker is dependent on
               training from the potential employer to perform the work. Where the worker brings
               specialized skills to the work relationship, this fact is not itself indicative of
               independent contractor status because both employees and independent contractors may
               be skilled workers. It is the worker's use of those specialized skills in connection
               with business-like initiative that indicates that the worker is an independent
               contractor.</span></li>

         </ol>

         <p class="p">Additional factors that look closely at investments by the worker; the employer's
            control; and whether the work performed is integral to the business may also be
            considered if the worker is in business for themself.</p>
