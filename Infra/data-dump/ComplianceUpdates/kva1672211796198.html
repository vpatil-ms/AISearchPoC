      <p class="p">The Biden administration has announced its Final Rule directing federal contractors to pay their workers a $15 minimum wage starting next year.</p>

      <p class="p">The Final Rule, effective January 30, 2022, establishes standards and procedures for implementing and enforcing the minimum wage protections of Executive Order 14026 (Order). Additionally, it sets forth an anti-retaliation provision, a prohibition against waiver of rights, and a severability clause. Finally, the Final Rule specifies procedures related to complaint intake, investigations, remedies, and administrative enforcement proceedings.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kva1672211796198__section_N1004C_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">On April 27, 2021, President Joe Biden issued the Order directing an increase in the minimum wage for certain federal contractors to $15.00 per hour for new or renewed contracts beginning January 30, 2022. In addition, the Order stipulates that the minimum cash wage for tipped employee will increase to $10.50 per hour on the same timeline and conditions (for new or renewed contracts).</p>
<p class="p">As of January 1, 2023, the required minimum wage may be adjusted each year by the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers.</p>
<p class="p">The Order also phases out the tipped minimum wage for certain federal contractors according to the following schedule:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Beginning January 30, 2022, federal contractors must pay tipped workers $10.50 per hour. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Beginning January 1, 2023, federal contractors must pay tipped workers 85% of the required minimum wage. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Beginning January 1, 2024, federal contractors must pay tipped workers the required minimum wage. <p class="p">If a tipped worker's hourly wages and tips do not amount to the higher minimum wage, the federal contractor must increase the hourly wage to make up the difference.</p>
<p class="p">The minimum wage for workers performing work on covered federal contracts is currently $10.95 per hour and the tipped minimum wage is $7.65.</p>
</span></li>

         </ul>
