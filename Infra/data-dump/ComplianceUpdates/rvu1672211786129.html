      <p class="p">The Massachusetts Attorney General's Fair Labor Division (FLD) has provided updated guidance to address leave and other issues related to the COVID-19 vaccine. The FLD's guidance is provided in the form of frequently asked questions and addresses various issues, including:</p>

      <section class="section" id="rvu1672211786129__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Q: Can my employer require me to get the vaccine in order to keep my job?</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> Maybe - unless you are not able to be vaccinated because of a
            protected legal right such as a disability or sincerely held religious belief. According
            to the EEOC, <span class="q">“the Americans with Disabilities Act allows an employer to have a
               qualification standard that includes ”</span>a requirement that an individual shall not
            pose a direct threat to the health or safety of individuals in the workplace.'" In most
            cases, employers have an obligation to engage in a flexible, interactive process with an
            employee who informs them that they are not vaccinated due to a disability, sincerely
            held religious belief, or other legally-protected reason. For more information, visit
            the EEOC's <a class="xref" href="https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-covid-19-and-ada-rehabilitation-act-and-other-eeo-laws" target="_blank">What You Should Know About COVID-19 and the ADA, the Rehabilitation
               Act, and Other EEO Laws</a>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="rvu1672211786129__section_N10061_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Q: If my employer requires me to get the vaccine, is the time spent getting the vaccine compensable working time?</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> In Massachusetts, <span class="q">“working time”</span> includes all time during
            which an employee is required to be on the employer's premises or at any other location.
            Therefore, if your employer mandates that you receive the vaccine at a specific location
            and/or on a specific date, this is likely to be considered <span class="q">“working time”</span> and
            therefore is compensable. If your employer simply requires proof of a vaccine, but does
            not mandate when, where and how you obtain it, this is unlikely to be considered
            compensable time. For a formal opinion, please contact the Massachusetts Department of
            Labor Standards at dlsfeedback@state.ma.us.</p>
<div class="note note" id="rvu1672211786129__note_N10076_N10061_N10041_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The guidance doesn't seem to address federal law. Even if the time spent getting the vaccine isn't ultimately considered working time under state law, it's possible pay is required by federal law when the employer requires vaccination. Consult legal counsel to discuss your rights and obligations under both state and federal law.</p>

      <section class="section" id="rvu1672211786129__section_N1007D_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Q: Is my travel time to and from the vaccination site compensable time? Does my employer have to reimburse me for mileage?</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> If an employee who regularly works at a fixed location is
            required to report to a location other than his or her regular work site, the employee
            must be compensated for all travel time in excess of his or her ordinary travel time
            between home and work and must be reimbursed for associated transportation expenses.
            Therefore, if your employer mandates that you receive the vaccine at a specific location
            and/or on a specific date, travel time and travel expenses may be compensable. If your
            employer simply requires proof of a vaccine, but does not mandate when, where and how
            you obtain it, travel to and from the vaccination site is unlikely to be considered
            compensable time. For a formal opinion, please contact the Massachusetts Department of
            Labor Standards at dlsfeedback@state.ma.us.</p>
