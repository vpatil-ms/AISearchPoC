      <p class="p">Maine's minimum wage will increase to $12.75 per hour on January 1, 2022. The change is a result of an annual adjustment for inflation.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Tipped Employees:</h2><p class="p">The minimum direct cash wage for tipped employees will be $6.38 per hour in 2022. If the employee's direct cash wages and tips don't equal or exceed the minimum wage ($12.75rnper hour), the employer must make up the difference.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Administrative, Professional, and Executive Exemptions:</h2><p class="p">To be classified as exempt from overtime under state law, bona fide administrative, professional, and executive employees must satisfy certain salary and duties tests. The minimum salary requirement for exemption is based on the state minimum wage. As a result of the change in the minimum wage, the minimum salary required for these exemptions under state law will increase to $735.59 per week, or $38,251 per year, on January 1, 2022.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">Maine employers must ensure that all non-exempt employees receive at least the minimum wage per hour and that exempt employees meet the minimum salary for exemption. Employers must also post an updated minimum wage notice. Once published by the state, the updated notice will be available for download from the State &amp; Federal Resources section of HR411®.</p>
<p class="p">Employers with exempt employees must ensure that these workers' salaries meet the new minimum salary requirement (as well as applicable duties tests). Otherwise, these workers must generally be classified as non-exempt and paid overtime whenever they work more than 40 hours in a workweek.</p>
<div class="note note"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The cities of Portland and Rockland in Maine have their own minimum wage laws. On January 1, 2022, the minimum wage in both cities will increase to $13 per hour. As such, work performed in these two cities by non-exempt employees must be compensated at a rate of at least $13 per hour. In Portland, however, from January 1, 2022 through January 13, 2022, non-exempt employees will need to be paid at least $19.50 per hour due to hazard pay requirements.</p>
