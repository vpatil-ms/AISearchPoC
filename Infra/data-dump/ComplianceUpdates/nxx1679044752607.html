      <p class="p">The California Department of Finance has <a class="xref" href="https://dof.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/documents/TwitterDocs/7.27.22-Minimum-Wage-Increase-Director-of-Finance-Determination-and-Certification-CC84-1.pdf" target="_blank">announced</a> the new minimum wage will increase to $15.50 per hour for all employees effective January 1, 2023.</p>

      <section class="section" id="nxx1679044752607__section_rk5_1kk_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Under California law, once the minimum wage reached $15.00 per hour, the Director of
            Finance on or before August 1 each year, must determine and certify to the Governor and
            the Legislature whether an adjustment for inflation will be applied to minimum wage
            beginning the following January 1 st. The minimum wage of $15.00 per hour became
            effective as of January 1, 2022 for employers who employ 26 or more employees and is
            scheduled for January 1, 2023 for employers who employ 25 or fewer employees.</p>

         <p class="p">California law also requires that when the rate of increase in inflation exceeds 7% in
            the first year in which the minimum wage for employers with 26 or more employees is
            $15.00 per hour, the minimum wage for employers with 25 or fewer employees must be set
            to the same amount as for employers with 26 or more employees.</p>

         <p class="p">Consequently, it has been determined that the minimum wage for employees, regardless of
            whether they are employed by employers with 26 or more or 25 or less employees will be
            $15.50 per hour effective January 1, 2023.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="nxx1679044752607__note_vsx_ckk_wwb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>California does not allow the use of a tip credit when paying tipped employees so
               tipped employees will be entitled to at least the minimum wage of $15.50 per hour in
               addition to tips.</p>
