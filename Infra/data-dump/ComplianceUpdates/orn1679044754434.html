      <p class="p">The requirement that private-sector employers pay its <span class="q">“manual workers”</span> on a weekly basis has been part of the New York Labor Code for many years. With few exceptions, <a class="xref" href="http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO:" target="_blank">New York Labor Code § 191</a> requires that manual workers must be paid no later than seven calendar days after the workweek where wages were earned.</p>

      <p class="p">Claims alleging employers failed to timely pay manual workers have become more common as a result of a 2019 New York court case ( <a class="xref" href="https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/appellate-division-first-department/2019/9733.html" target="_blank">Vega v. CM Associates Construction Management</a> ) that determined employees may sue employers over late wages, even if the wages have been fully paid. The court also found that an employee may be bring suit even if the NYDOL chooses not to pursue action against the employer. Employers found to be in violation of the pay frequency law must pay the full amount of delayed wages, plus attorney fees and interest. This is the case even if the employee's wages were paid in full on a bi-weekly basis.</p>

                  Worker”</span>?</span></p>
<p class="p">New York Labor Code § 194 defines a <span class="q">“manual worker”</span> to mean <span class="q">“a mechanic, workingman or laborer.”</span></p>
<p class="p">In a <a class="xref" href="https://dol.ny.gov/frequency-pay" target="_blank">frequently asked question</a> (FAQ), the New York Department of Labor (NYDOL) added the following comment regarding the statutory definition:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="q">“It has been the long-standing interpretation of this Department that individuals who spend more than 25% of working time engaged in ”</span>physical labor<span class="q">“ fit within the meaning of the term ”</span>manual worker." Furthermore, the term "physical labor" has been interpreted broadly to include countless physical tasks performed by employees."</p>
<p class="p">A <a class="xref" href="https://statistics.labor.ny.gov/legal/counsel/pdf/Other/RO-09-0066%20Manual%20Workers.pdf" target="_blank">NYDOL opinion letter</a> has also suggested that <span class="q">“as a cautionary measure, a prudent employer would pay any employees whose position might be considered to be within the meaning of ”</span>manual worker<span class="q">“ not less than once a week since such frequency would satisfy the most stringent requirements prescribed by New York Labor Law Section 191.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Are there exceptions and different pay frequency rules
               for other workers?</span></p>
<p class="p">Manual workers for non-profit entities must be paid in accordance with their agreed terms of employment but not less frequently than semi-monthly. In addition, large employers of manual workers may apply to the Commissioner of Labor to pay manual workers semi-monthly (see the <a class="xref" href="https://dol.ny.gov/frequency-pay" target="_blank">NYDOL FAQs</a> for more information).</p>
<p class="p"><span class="q">“Railroad Workers”</span> must be paid on or before Thursday of each week and must include wages earned during the seven-day period ending on the Tuesday of the preceding week.</p>
<p class="p"> <span class="q">“Commission Salespersons”</span> must be paid in accordance with the agreed terms set forth in the written commission agreement but not less frequently than once in each month and not later than the last day of the month following the month in which the wages are earned. If wages are substantial (currently $900 per week), additional compensation earned, including extra or incentive earnings, may be paid less frequently than once in each month.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="q">“Clerical or Other Workers”</span> must be paid in accordance with the agreed terms of employment and not less frequently than semi-monthly.</p>
<p class="p">The pay frequency requirements do not apply to persons employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity whose earnings are in excess of $900 a week (see the <a class="xref" href="https://dol.ny.gov/frequency-pay" target="_blank">NYDOL FAQs</a> for more information).</p>
<p class="p">Federal, state, and local government employers are also not subject to the pay frequency requirements.</p>
