      <p class="p">New York state and New York City have amended their Human Rights laws to add employment protections for domestic workers. The state's protections went into effect on December 31, 2021, and the City's protections will take effect on March 12, 2022.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xxn1672211799090__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2><p class="p">Domestic workers are those employed at homes or residence as housekeepers, home healthcare aides, nannies or similar roles.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xxn1672211799090__section_N10052_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">New York State:</h2>
         
         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Background:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The New York State Human Rights Law (NYSHRL) protects employees from
            discrimination on the basis of age, race, religion, color, national origin, sexual
            orientation, gender identity or expression, military status, sex, disability, among
            other protected characteristics.</p>

         <p class="p">Under state law, a person doesn't need to live with an employer to be a
            domestic worker, but they are not considered a domestic worker under law if they're
            employed by their parents, spouse, or a child.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Senate Bill S5064:</span></p>

         <p class="p">New York has enacted legislation (Senate Bill S5064), which amends the
            NYSHRL to add domestic workers to the definition of <span class="q">“employees”</span> and
            grants domestic workers the protections afforded to employees under the law. It also
            prohibits employers from retaliating against a domestic worker for opposing any unlawful
            practices under the law or because the worker has filed a complaint. Senate Bill S5064
            took effect December 31, 2021.</p>

            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The New York Division of Human Rights has released additional <a class="xref" href="https://dhr.ny.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/DHR-Domestic-Workers-Update.pdf" target="_blank">guidance</a> for employers on the new
               protections under the NYSHRL.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xxn1672211799090__section_N10079_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">New York City:</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Background:</span></p>
<p class="p">The New York City Human Rights Law (NYCHRL) provides employment protections against discrimination, harassment, and retaliation to domestic workers, including entitlements to certain reasonable accommodations under the law.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Int. No. 339-B:</span></p>
<p class="p">New York City has enacted legislation (Int. No. 339-B), which will extend the law to require all employers with one or more domestic workers to provide nondiscrimination protections, beginning March 12, 2022. The NYCHRL also prohibits sexual harassment from employers, family members and others in a household.</p>
<p class="p">The NYC Commission on Human Rights has released <a class="xref" href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/cchr/downloads/pdf/publications/Domestic-Workers-339-FAQ.pdf" target="_blank">FAQs</a> on topics such as hiring, workplace conduct,
            nondiscrimination, background and reference checks, termination, and non-retaliation
            measures for domestic employment. The protections cover most full-time and part-time
            workers.</p>
<p class="p">Under the guidance, employers cannot take the following actions towards domestic workers:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, sex, religion, age, perceived immigration status, or other protected characteristic; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Inquire about salary history or credit history while hiring. However, employers may check an applicant's employment references, education history, and criminal convictions; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide a bad reference (or no) reference to retaliate against a domestic worker that engages in protected activity. However, they may provide negative references, provided they are truthful; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Retaliate because a domestic worker raised a complaint of discrimination; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Use language in job ads that limit the employment of a domestic worker of a certain race, gender, national origin, religion, or other protected class. However, employers may seek specific job skills. </span></li>
