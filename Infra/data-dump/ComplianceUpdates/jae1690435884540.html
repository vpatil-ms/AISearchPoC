      <p class="p">Oregon has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 999), which, for leave purposes, amends the definition of a one-year period, expands who qualifies as a family member, and adds employee reinstatement requirements under the Oregon Family Leave Act, among other things. Most of the changes take effect on September 3, 2023.</p>

<p class="p">Effective July 1, 2024, Senate Bill 999 amends the definition of a one-year period to mean:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A consecutive 12-month period, such as a calendar year or fiscal year; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A period of 52 consecutive weeks that starts the Sunday before the date that the OFLA leave begins. For example, the one-year period for an employee's OFLA leave that starts on Wednesday, July 3, 2024, would span from Sunday, June 30, 2024, to Saturday, June 28, 2025. </span></li>

<p class="p">The Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries will adopt rules for determining whether a close association exists (which may include a form) by September 3, 2023.</p>

Additionally, if an equivalent position is not available at the same job site, the employee may be offered an equivalent job at a different location that is within 20 miles of the previous job site.</p>
<p class="p">Beginning September 3, 2023, if there is no equivalent position at the same job site, an employer must offer an equivalent position at a different location if a position is available, but the location only needs to be within 50 miles of the prior job site. And, if equivalent jobs are available at multiple sites, employers must offer the position at the job site that is closest to the employee's previous job site.</p>

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Employees must continue making regular contributions to their health insurance premiums while on leave; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers that choose to cover the employee's portion of the insurance premium while
               the employee is on leave (not mandatory) may deduct those costs from the employee's
               paycheck upon the employee's return from leave. Note: These deductions may not
               exceed10% of the employee's gross pay. </span></li>
