The amendments require new public health emergency leave (PHEL) and pay protections for employees, gig workers, and others who do not receive leave under the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA).</p>

      <section class="section" id="jfz1672211781418__section_N10055_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">PHFWO Regulations (December 2020):</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The City of Philadelphia released new regulations that define key terms in Ordinances
            200306 and 200303 and clarify the circumstances under which each type of leave benefit
            (PHEL or Health Epidemic Leave) may be used. Below is a summary:</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">PHEL(Ordinance 200303):</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Covered employers: Any hiring entity that employs a covered individual, unless the
               employer provides paid leave that can be used for the same purposes and under all the
               same conditions as PHEL and provides leave in the same or greater amount as required
               under applicable City law. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When leave may be taken: Covered individuals may use PHEL for a COVID-19 related
               purpose beginning on September 17, 2020, and continuing until the earlier of one
               month after the conclusion of the Public Health Emergency or December 31, 2020. A
               hiring entity is not required to allow a covered individual to take PHEL if they're
               reasonably able to perform work remotely. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Reasonable documentation: Reasonable documentation of the need for leave may
               include, but is not limited to, a public statement from a government official, the
               City Department of Public Health, or the Center for Disease Control if the statement
               specifically addresses the covered individual's circumstances. Documentation from a
               governmental official is not required; however, an employer may require a signed
               statement from an employee affirming leave was for a covered reason. Consistent with
               CDC guidance, employers may not require a note from a health care professional. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Health Epidemic Leave (Ordinance 2000306):</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Covered employers: Any employer that provides healthcare services and employs 10 or
               more employees for at least 40 weeks in a calendar year must provide Healthcare
               Epidemic Leave. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When leave may be taken: Covered individuals are entitled to Healthcare Epidemic
               Leave for the time period in which the employee is unable to work due to the
               employee's contraction of COVID-19. The leave should begin on the earlier of: (a) the
               date of the first positive COVID-19 test; or (b) the date the employee's isolation
               begins pursuant to either a federal, state or local governmental isolation order; or
               a written isolation recommendation from either a healthcare employer or a healthcare
               provider. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Reasonable documentation: The following are examples of acceptable documentation:
               (a) a positive COVID-19 test or written communication from a healthcare provider
               indicating a positive COVID-19 test; (b) a federal, state, or local governmental
               isolation order; or (c) a written isolation recommendation from a healthcare
               provider. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Interaction with other types of leave: A employee that chooses to take Healthcare
               Epidemic Leave is not entitled to take any other leave benefit for the same purpose.
               Additionally, the Health Care Employer may not require the employee to use the other
               leave concurrently. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Common Reasons for Leave:</p>

         <p class="p">The regulations provide a non-inclusive list of common circumstances in which the
            different types of leave may be permitted. These include:</p>
