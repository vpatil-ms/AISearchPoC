      <p class="p">Illinois has enacted legislation that expands requirements for certain employers to provide bereavement leave to employees. The legislation (Senate Bill 2034) takes effect January 1, 2024.</p>

      <section class="section" id="bqp1693461687479__section_nd2_2nf_qyb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Under the new law, an employee of an employer with 250 or more full-time employees in
            Illinois is entitled to use a maximum of 12 weeks of unpaid leave if the employee
            experiences the loss of a child by suicide or homicide.</p>

         <p class="p">An employee of an employer with 50 to 249 full-time employees in Illinois is entitled to
            use up to 6 weeks of unpaid leave if the employee experiences the loss of a child by
            suicide or homicide.</p>

         <p class="p">The leave may be taken in a single continuous period or intermittently in increments of
            no less than four hours, but leave must be completed within one year after the employee
            notifies the employer of the loss.</p>

         <p class="p">To be eligible for such leave, the individual must:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="bqp1693461687479__ul_u1q_2nf_qyb">
            <li><span class="li">Be a full-time employee of an employer with at least 50 full-time employees in
               Illinois. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Work for the employer for at least 2 weeks. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">An employee who is entitled to take paid or unpaid leave pursuant to federal, state or
            local law, a collective bargaining agreement, or an employment benefits program or plan
            may elect to substitute any period of such leave for an equivalent period of leave
            provided under Senate Bill 2034.</p>

<p class="p">An employer may require reasonable documentation, such as a death certificate, a published obituary, or written verification of death, burial or memorial services from a mortuary, funeral home, burial society, crematorium, religious institution or government agency. An employer may require that the documentation include the cause of death.</p>
