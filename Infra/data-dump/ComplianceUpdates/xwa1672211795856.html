      <p class="p">New Jersey has enacted legislation (Assembly Bill 681) to further protect employees from age discrimination under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (NJLAD). Assembly Bill 681 is effective immediately.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xwa1672211795856__section_w198ab1b5b3_w199ab1b5_w200ab1"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act prohibits employers with 20 or more employees from age discrimination against applicants or employees aged 40 or older. The NJLAD prohibits all employers from age discrimination against individuals who are 18 years or older (among other protected characteristics). Historically, the NJLAD had a carve out where employers who failed to hire or promote employees over the age of 70 were shielded from age discrimination claims and aggrieved employees were limited in the remedies they could pursue.</p>

The law also allows employees over 70 to pursue additional remedies, including a private right of action for forced retirement, against their employer if they are forced to retire.</p>
