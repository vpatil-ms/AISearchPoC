      <p class="p">The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued updated guidance on recording occupational illnesses related to COVID-19. The guidance took effect May 26, 2020 and remains in effect until further notice.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ctd1672211773155__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">Under federal regulations, employers with more than 10 employees must keep records of work-related injuries and illnesses, unless the business is classified under one of the partially exempt low-hazard industries. However, all employers must report to OSHA work-related injuries and illnesses that result in a fatality or an employee's in-patient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="ctd1672211773155__section_N10052_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Updated Guidance:</h2><p class="p">Under OSHA's recordkeeping requirements, COVID-19 is a recordable illness, and thus employers are responsible for recording cases of COVID-19 if:</p>
<ol class="concept">
            <li><span class="li">The case is a confirmed case of COVID-19, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The case is work-related as defined by <a class="xref" href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1904/1904.5" target="_blank">29 CFR § 1904.5</a>; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The case involves one or more of the general recording criteria set forth in <a class="xref" href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1904/1904.7" target="_blank">29 CFR § 1904.7</a>. </span></li>

         </ol>
<p class="p">OSHA says employers should be taking action to determine whether employee COVID-19 illnesses are work-related and thus recordable. In determining whether an employer has complied with this obligation, OSHA will consider:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">The reasonableness of the investigation.</span> In most
               circumstances when an employer learns of an employee's COVID-19 illness, the employer may:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">Ask the employee how they believe they contracted COVID-19; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">While respecting employee privacy, discuss with the employee their work and
                     out-of-work activities that may have led to the COVID-19 illness; and </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Review the employee's work environment for potential exposure to determine if
                     there are any other instances of workers in that environment contracting
                     COVID-19 illness. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">The evidence available.</span> The evidence that a COVID-19
               illness was work-related will be considered based on the information reasonably
               available to the employer at the time it made its work-relatedness determination. If
               the employer later learns more information related to an employee's COVID-19 illness,
               then that information would be taken into account as well in determining whether an
               employer made a reasonable determination. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">The evidence that a COVID-19 illness was contracted at
                  work.</span> Evidence that may weigh in favor of or against work-relatedness includes:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">Whether several cases develop among workers who work closely together and
                     there is no alternative explanation. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Whether it is contracted shortly after lengthy, close exposure to a particular
                     customer or coworker who has a confirmed case of COVID-19 and there is no
                     alternative explanation. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Whether their job duties include having frequent, close exposure to the
                     general public in a locality with ongoing community transmission and there is
                     no alternative explanation. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Whether the employee is the only worker to contract COVID-19 in their vicinity
                     and their job duties don't include having frequent contact with the general
                     public, regardless of the rate of community spread. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Whether the employee, outside the workplace, closely and frequently associates
                     with someone (such as, a family member, significant other, or close friend)
                     who: (1) has COVID-19; (2) isn't a coworker; and (3) exposes the employee
                     during the period in which the individual is likely infectious. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="ctd1672211773155__section_N100BD_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">Employers should make a good-faith inquiry about whether COVID-19 cases are work-related, as described above. If the criteria are met, COVID-19 should be coded as a respiratory illness on the OSHA Form 300. Because COVID-19 is an illness, if an employee requests that their name not be entered on the log, the employer must comply.</p>
