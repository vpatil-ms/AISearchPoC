      <section class="section" id="xde1672211796461__section_N10077_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Paid Leave:</h2><p class="p">The ordinance requires that employers provide at least 96 compensated hours of time off per year for sick leave, vacation, or personal necessity to full-time employees. Full-time employees are entitled to accrue at least 96/52 (1.846) hours of compensated time off each week of employment. Compensated time off doesn't accrue for work in excess of 40 hours a week. Full-time employees who work less than 40 hours a week will receive the compensated time off in proportional increments.</p>
<p class="p">Part-time employees are entitled to accrue compensated time off in increments proportional to that accrued by someone who works 40 hours a week. For example, a part-time employee who works 30 hours per week would be entitled to 72 hours of compensated time off per year, accruing at 72/52 (1.385) hours per week of employment.</p>
<p class="p">Highlights of Paid Leave:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Employees must be eligible to use accrued paid compensated time off after the first six months of employment or consistent with company policies, whichever is sooner.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers may not unreasonably deny an employee's request to use the accrued compensated time off.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Unused accrued compensated time off must carry over until the time off reaches a maximum of 192 hours unless the employer's established policy is more generous.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">After an employee reaches the maximum accrued compensated time off (192 hours), an employer must provide a cash payment once every 30 days for accrued compensated time off over the maximum. An employer may provide an employee with the option of cashing out any portion of, or all of, the employee's accrued compensated time off under the maximum, but, in no event, is the employer allowed to require an employee to cash out any accrued compensated time off.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Compensated time off cashed out will be paid to the employee at the wage rate that the employee is earning at the time of cash out.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employer may not implement any employment policy to count accrued compensated time off taken as an absence that may result in discipline, discharge, suspension, or any other adverse action. </span></li>

Full-time employees who work less than 40 hours a week will receive the uncompensated time off in proportional increments.</p>
<p class="p">A full-time employee is entitled to accrue 80/52 (1.538) hours of uncompensated time off each week employed. Uncompensated time off doesn't accrue for work in excess of 40 hours a week. Full-time employees who work less than 40 hours a week will receive the uncompensated time off in proportional increments.</p>
