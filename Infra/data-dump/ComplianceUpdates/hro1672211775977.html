      <p class="p">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has adopted a temporary policy in response to delays in the government's production of certain Employment Authorization Documents (Form I-766, EAD) for the purposes of completing Form I-9.</p>

      <section class="section" id="hro1672211775977__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The Form I-9 is used to verify a new hire's identity and work authorization. All employers must
            ensure that each employee properly completes the I-9 at the time of hire. To complete
            Section 2 of the I-9, employees must generally present documents that verify their
            identity and employment authorization. The I-9 Form includes a List of Acceptable
            Documents (List A, List B, and List C). An employee must present one document from List
            A or one document from List B <span class="ph em">and</span> one document from List
            C.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">List A documents: establish both identity and employment authorization </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">List B documents: establish identity only </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">List C documents: establish employment authorization only </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="hro1672211775977__section_N10066_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">DHS Temporary Policy:</h2><p class="p">In response to delays in producing certain EADs, the DHS is allowing employees to temporarily use Form I-797 (Notice of Action) as a List C document. To be accepted under the temporary policy, Form I-797 must be dated on or after December 1, 2019 through August 20, 2020 and inform the applicant that their Application for Employment Authorization (AEA) is approved, even though the notice states it isn't evidence of employment authorization. Employees may present Form I-797 as a List C document until December 1, 2020. For Form I-9 completion, employees who present a Form I-797 for new employment must also present their employer with an acceptable List B document that establishes identity.</p>
<p class="p">By December 1, 2020, employers must reverify employees who presented Form I-797. These employees will need to present new evidence of employment authorization from either List A or List C. Note that it's the employees' choice whether to present their new EADs, or a different document from either List A or List C.</p>
