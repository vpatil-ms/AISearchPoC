      <p class="p">The Illinois Department of Human Rights has released new guidance on sexual harassment training requirements that went into effect January 1, 2020.</p>

      <section class="section" id="mrr1672211768900__section_w15ab1b5b3_w16ab1b5_w17ab1"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">In 2019, Illinois enacted legislation (Senate Bill 75) that imposes new requirements for employers to provide sexual harassment training. Under the law, effective January 1, 2020, private employers with employees working in Illinois must provide training on preventing sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="p">The training must be provided to all employees at least once each year. Employers must either use model training that will be created by the state or adopt their own training that meets or exceeds state requirements.</p>
<p class="p">Restaurants and bars are subject to additional requirements.</p>

      <section class="section" id="mrr1672211768900__section_w18ab1b5b5_w19ab1b5_w20ab1"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Guidance:</h2><p class="p">The guidance includes answers to frequently asked questions, which indicate that:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The model training will be available at some point in February 2020 <a class="xref" href="http://www.illinois.gov/dhr/training" target="_blank">here</a>. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Any employee who works or will work in Illinois must be trained,
               regardless of their status (such as short-term, part-time, or intern) or whether the
               employer is based in Illinois. If an employee is based elsewhere but regularly
               interacts with other employees in Illinois, even if they are not physically present
               in Illinois, they <span class="ph strong">should</span> be trained. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers must provide their employees with training by December 31, 2020 and annually thereafter. However, employers are encouraged to train employees as soon as possible. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If employees have disabilities or speak a language other than English, employers must train employees in a manner that is accessible to them. </span></li>
