<p class="p">It is important to note that the Ordinance allows a one-year court granted waiver under the conditions as described below:</p>
<p class="p">This article is not intended to cause reduction in employment or work hours for Healthcare Workers. Therefore, a court may grant a one-year waiver from the Minimum Wage requirements of this article if an Employer can demonstrate by substantial evidence that compliance with this article would raise substantial doubt about the Employer's ability to continue as a going concern under generally accepted accounting standards. The evidence must include documentation of the Employer's financial condition, as well as the condition of any parent or affiliated entity, and evidence of the actual or potential direct financial impact of compliance with this article. A one-year waiver granted by a court pursuant to this section does not exempt an Employer from complying with any and all federal, state, or local laws and regulations, including any other applicable federal, state, or local minimum wage requirement.</p>
