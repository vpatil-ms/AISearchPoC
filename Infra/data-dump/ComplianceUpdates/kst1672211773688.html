      <p class="p">Chicago has published final rules, frequently asked questions, and a notice
         for employers covered by the city's Fair Workweek Ordinance, which takes effect <span class="ph strong">July 1, 2020</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kst1672211773688__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">In 2019, Chicago enacted an ordinance requiring certain employers to notify employees of their schedules in advance and pay employees when they provide insufficient notice of schedule changes.</p>
<p class="p">To be covered by the ordinance:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employer must employ 100 or more employees globally (250 or more employees for not-for-profit corporations); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">At least 50 of those employees must be considered covered employees (see below); <span class="ph em">and</span></span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employer must be primarily engaged in one of the following covered industries:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">Building Services; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Healthcare; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Hotels; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Manufacturing; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Restaurants; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Retail; or </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Warehouse Services. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Under the ordinance, a covered employee is one who:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Performs work in the capacity of an employee, as distinguished from a contractor, or is a worker for temporary agency who has been on assignment to the employer for 420 hours within an 18-month period; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Spends most of their work time within the City of Chicago; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Performs most of their work in a covered industry for that employer; <span class="ph strong">and</span></span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Earns $50,000 or less per year as a salaried employee, or $26.00 or less per hour as an hourly employee (these amounts will be adjusted for inflation). </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The ordinance contains various provisions, including:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Posting work schedule:</span> Employers must
               post covered employees' work schedules no later than 10 days before the first day of
               any new schedule. This deadline increases to 14 days beginning July 1, 2022. The
               schedule must include the shifts and on-call status of all current covered employees
               at that worksite. Additionally, it must be posted conspicuously within the workplace
               and readily accessible and visible to all covered employees or via the usual methods
               of communication. Additionally, upon written request, the employer must transmit the
               schedule electronically. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Right to decline unscheduled hours:</span>
               Covered employees can decline to work unscheduled hours offered to them within 10
               days of the beginning of the work schedule in which those additional hours are
               proposed. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Predictability pay:</span> Covered employees
               receive one hour of additional pay when hours are added to a shift, or a shift's time
               or date is changed with no change to the number of hours, within 10 days of the
               beginning of the work schedule during which that shift takes place. Predictability
               pay also applies when hours are subtracted from a shift within 10 days of the start
               of the work schedule in which that shift takes place, but with more than 24 hours'
               notice from the beginning of that shift. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Pay for cancelled hours and shifts:</span>
               Covered employees receive no less than 50% of their pay for any hours that are
               cancelled with less than 24 hours' notice from the beginning of the shift during
               which those cancelled hours were to take place. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Right to rest:</span> Covered employees can
               decline shifts that begin less than 10 hours following the end of the previous day's
               shift. When covered employees agree to work such a shift, they are then paid at 1.25
               time their base rate of pay. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Initial estimate of work schedule:</span>
               Covered employees must receive an initial good faith estimate of their work schedule,
               including the days of the week they can be expected to work, and the start and end
               times of their shifts for those days. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Employer notice:</span> Employers must post a
               notice advising covered employees of their rights under the ordinance. Employers must
               also provide a notice with each covered employee's first paycheck on or after July 1,
               2020. </span></li>

         </ul>

<p class="p">Among other things, the <a class="xref" href="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/dol/rulesandregs/Fair%20Workweek%20Rules.pdf" target="_blank">final rules</a> clarify that:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">An employer may change a previously scheduled regular shift as posted by 15 minutes or less without being obligated to provide predictability pay. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers may add a covered employee to a work schedule with less than the required notice when they are returning from a leave of absence. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers must post the <a class="xref" href="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/bacp/OSL/20200518fwwnoticefinalv2ledger.pdf" target="_blank">required notice</a> through the employers' usual methods of communication for such notices, whether by paper posting or by electronic dissemination through the employers' internal communication channels. When posting a paper notice, the notice must be printed on and scaled to fill a sheet of paper that measures 11 inches by 17 inches. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The <a class="xref" href="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/bacp/OSL/20200518fwwnoticefinalv2.pdf" target="_blank">notice</a> that employers must provide with the first paycheck advising the covered employee of their rights must be printed on and scaled to fit a sheet of paper that measures 8.5 inches by 11 inches. However, where covered employees are enrolled in direct deposit, employers may provide the notice through the employers' usual methods of electronic communication. This notice must also be provided with employee paychecks annually on or following July 1. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">All notices must be posted in English and any language(s) spoken by employees at the facility who are not proficient in English and in which city has provided non-English language notices. As of June 9, 2020, the city has published the notices in <a class="xref" href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/bacp/supp_info/fairworkweek.html" target="_blank">English and Spanish</a>. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The <a class="xref" href="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/bacp/OSL/20200518fwwshortfaqfinalmb.pdf" target="_blank">frequently asked questions</a> address various issues, including COVID-19. In the answer to one question, the city states that if COVID-19 causes a material change to an employer's operations that creates the need for a schedule change, the employer is exempt from certain provisions of the ordinance (right to decline, predictability pay, and pay for cancelled hours and shifts) for the work schedule during which the change takes place, as well as the following work schedule.</p>
