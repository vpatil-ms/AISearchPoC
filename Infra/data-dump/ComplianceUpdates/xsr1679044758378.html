      <p class="p">Utah has amended its mobile workforce taxation rules, which create a taxation exemption for certain employees that work a limited time in the state annually. The amendments also modify the employer's withholding obligations and penalties associated with that obligation.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xsr1679044758378__section_okz_g4l_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Beginning with the taxable year starting on or after January 1, 2023, under the
            amendment as enacted by <a class="xref" href="https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/sbillenr/SB0039.pdf" target="_blank">SB
               0039</a>, a nonresident individual's wages may not be considered income derived
            from Utah sources if the nonresident individual:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="xsr1679044758378__ul_zgv_34l_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Has no other income from sources within this state for the taxable year in which
               they receive the wages; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Is present in this state to perform employment duties for 20 or fewer days during
               the tax year; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Has a state of residence that: <ul class="ul" id="xsr1679044758378__ul_ahv_34l_wwb">
                  <li><span class="li">Provides a substantially similar exclusion; or </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Does not impose a state individual income tax. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">This exemption does not apply to the wages paid to a member of a professional athletic
            team or a professional entertainer. In addition, individuals of prominence who perform
            services for wages on a per-event basis and individuals who perform construction
            services to improve real property, predominantly on a construction site, as laborers are
            not covered by the exemption.</p>

         <p class="p">Additionally, under the new legislation, an employer making payment of wages may not
            deduct or withhold any amount from wages paid to a nonresident individual if the
            nonresident individual's wages are excluded from state source income under the
            regulations effective January 1, 2023.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers should review <a class="xref" href="https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/sbillenr/SB0039.pdf" target="_blank">SB
               0039</a> and discuss with their legal and or tax advisor to ensure adherence to
            the rules effective January 1, 2023.</p>
