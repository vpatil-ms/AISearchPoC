         <p class="p">The Virginia Safety and Health Codes Board enacted an <a class="xref" href="https://www.jacksonlewis.com/publication/virginia-passes-first-nation-osha-standard-covid-19" target="_blank">Emergency Temporary Standard</a> to address COVID-19 safety

         <p class="p">Virginia has provided <a class="xref" href="https://www.doli.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DOLI-Guidance-for-Employers-to-Mitigate-the-Risk-of-COVID-19-to-Workers-03.01.2022_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">guidance</a> that replaces the ETS, effective March 23, 2022.</p>

         <p class="p">Under the guidance, employers cannot discriminate against or terminate an employee for
            wearing (or not wearing) a mask, with limited exceptions, such as in places where masks
            are required by law or in certain medical situations or healthcare locations.</p>

         <p class="p">The guidance also instructs employers to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by having
            workers use employer-provided face coverings or surgical masks and encouraging workers
            to stay home if they are infected with COVID-19 or experience its symptoms. Workers with
            COVID-19 symptoms should be encouraged to seek a physician's advice on testing and
            treatment.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers should also engage workers to mitigate COVID-19 transmission by:</p>

            <li><span class="li">Prioritizing sanitary work practices, such as frequent handwashing; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Using languages that employees understand to teach them COVID-19 policies; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Operating and maintaining ventilation systems to manufacturers' specifications; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Following VOSH recordkeeping and reporting standards for work-related COVID-19
               cases, and other applicable VOSH standards, including respiratory protections,
               personal protective equipment, sanitation, bloodborne pathogens, and the Virginia
               General Duty Clause that requires employers to provide employment and a workplace
               free of recognized hazards. </span></li>

      <section class="section" id="kjz1679044747905__section_yh5_g3j_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Next Steps:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Virginia employers should continue to monitor and ensure compliance with the new
            guidance and any federal, state and/or local laws and orders that pertain to vaccine
            and/or masking mandates when creating and enforcing their policies.</p>
