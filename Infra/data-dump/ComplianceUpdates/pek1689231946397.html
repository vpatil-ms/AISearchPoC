      <p class="p">Louisiana has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 200), which will require employers with 20 or more employees to provide leave to employees for genetic testing and cancer screening when medically necessary. The changes take effect August 1, 2023.</p>

      <section class="section" id="pek1689231946397__section_c1g_bpn_cyb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">When medically necessary, an employer must grant an employee a day's leave of absence
            from work to obtain genetic testing or preventive cancer screening.</p>

         <p class="p">To be considered medically necessary, the testing or screening must be in accordance
            with generally accepted evidence-based medical standards, or that are considered by most
            physicians or independent licensed practitioners within the community of their
            respective professional organizations to be the standard of care.</p>

         <p class="p">The services must also be deemed reasonably necessary to diagnose, correct, cure,
            alleviate or prevent the worsening of a condition or conditions that endanger life,
            cause suffering or pain, or have resulted or will result in a handicap, physical
            deformity or malfunction, and those for which no equally effective and less costly
            course of treatment is available or suitable for the recipient.</p>

<p class="p">The employee must provide documentation confirming the performance of such genetic testing or cancer screening when requested by the employer. An employee mustn't be required to disclose the results of genetic testing or a preventative cancer screening.</p>

      <section class="section" id="pek1689231946397__section_N10062_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Pay During Leave</h2><p class="p">The leave may be unpaid. However, an employee must be permitted to substitute any accrued vacation time or other appropriate paid leave for this purpose.</p>

      <section class="section" id="pek1689231946397__section_N1006C_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employer Notice</h2><p class="p">Covered employers must post a notice in a conspicuous location setting forth the requirements of the law. The notice will be prepared by the Louisiana Workforce Commission.</p>

      <section class="section" id="pek1689231946397__section_vxb_dpn_cyb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Next Steps</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Covered Louisiana employers should review policies and procedures to ensure compliance
            with Senate Bill 200 by August 1, 2023, and post the required notice.</p>
