      <p class="p">New York's rules for paying certain tipped employees will change beginning
            <span class="ph strong">June 30, 2020</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="fbt1672211768359__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"> Background:</h2><p class="p">Currently, under the <span class="ph em">Wage Order for Miscellaneous Industries
               and Occupations</span>, covered employers may count tips that employees receive toward
            meeting the minimum wage, as long as the employee's direct cash wages and tips equals or
            exceeds the applicable state minimum wage. This is known as a tip credit.</p>
<p class="p">The following tipped workers may be covered by the <span class="ph em">Miscellaneous</span> Wage Order: nail salon workers, hairdressers, aestheticians, car
            wash workers, valet parking attendants, door-persons, tow truck drivers, dog groomers,
            and tour guides.</p>

            employers covered by the Wage Order for <span class="ph em">Miscellaneous Industries
               and Occupations</span> will be phased out this year. Effective <span class="ph strong">June 30, 2020</span>, the tip credit will be reduced by 50 percent.</p>
<p class="p">Effective <span class="ph strong">December 31, 2020</span>, the ability to claim a
            tip credit for employers covered by the Wage Order for <span class="ph em">Miscellaneous Industries and Occupations</span> will be eliminated completely. Covered
            employers will be required to pay all employees the full minimum wage directly, without
            any credit for tips these employees receive.</p>
