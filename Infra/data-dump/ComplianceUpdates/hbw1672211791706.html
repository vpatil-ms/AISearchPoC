      <p class="p">The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has issued a final rule to rescind regulations that
         established a new test for joint employment under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act
         (FLSA). The change takes effect <span class="ph strong">September 28, 2021</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="hbw1672211791706__section_N1004D_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The FLSA requires employers to pay non-exempt employees at least the minimum wage for each hour worked and overtime when they work more than 40 hours in a workweek. There are also certain recordkeeping requirements. Under the FLSA, more than one employer may be responsible for complying with the FLSA and for violations when a joint-employer relationship exists. For example, a joint employer relationship could occur where a hotel contracts with a staffing agency to provide cleaning staff, which the hotel directly controls. If the agency and the hotel are joint employers, they are both responsible for worker protections.</p>
<p class="p"> In early 2020, the Trump Administration issued regulations that changed the test for determining whether a joint-employer relationship exists for the purposes of the FLSA. Under those regulations, joint employment exists where the other entity is acting directly or indirectly in the interest of the employer in relation to the employee. To apply this standard, the regulations established a four-part test that looked at whether the potential joint employer:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Hires or fires the employee; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Supervises and controls the employee's work schedules or conditions of employment to a substantial degree; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Determines the employee's rate and method of payment; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Maintains the employee's employment records. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Those regulations took effect March 16, 2020 but were vacated by a federal court in New York in September 2020.</p>

In rescinding the regulations, the DOL said the four-part test was too rigid and may not have easily encompassed all scenarios in which joint employment may arise. The DOL also said the test was different, to varying degrees, from the tests applied by every court to have considered joint-employer questions.</p>

      <section class="section" id="hbw1672211791706__section_N1007A_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">The DOL says it will continue to consider legal and policy issues relating to joint employment before determining whether alternative regulatory or guidance is appropriate. In the meantime, employers should watch for developments closely and consult legal counsel when determining whether a joint-employment relationship exists.</p>
