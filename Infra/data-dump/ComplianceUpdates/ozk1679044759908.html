      <p class="p">New York has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 9427A), which requires employers to disclose compensation or the range of compensation to applicants and employees. Senate Bill 9427A takes effect September 17, 2023.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ozk1679044759908__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
                  <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Definitions:</span></p>

                  <p class="p">Under Senate Bill 9427A, the <span class="ph em">range of
                              compensation</span> is defined as the minimum and maximum annual salary
                        or hourly range of compensation for a job, promotion or transfer opportunity
                        that the employer, in good faith, believes to be accurate at the time of the
                        posting of an advertisement for such opportunity.</p>

                  <p class="p">The law also defines <span class="ph em">an employer</span> as
                        any person, corporation, limited liability company, association, labor
                        organization or entity employing four or more employees in any occupation,
                        industry, trade, business or service, or any agent thereof; and any person,
                        corporation, limited liability company, association or entity acting as an
                        employment agent or recruiter, or otherwise connecting applicants with
                        employers.</p>

                  <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Pay disclosure:</span></p>

                  <p class="p">Employers must disclose the compensation or a range of compensation and the job
                        description (if it exists) for each job, promotion or transfer opportunity,
                        when advertising for such a position that can or will be performed, at least
                        in part, in New York.</p>

                  <p class="p">Employers are prohibited from refusing to interview, hire, promote or employ,
                        or retaliating against an applicant or current employee for exercising any
                        rights under the law.</p>

                  <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Penalties:</span></p>

                  <p class="p">Employers that are found to have failed to comply with a requirement under the

<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Recordkeeping:</span></p>

                        requirements under the law. This includes the history of compensation ranges
                        for each job, promotion or transfer opportunity, and the job description for
                        such a position (if it exists).</p>
