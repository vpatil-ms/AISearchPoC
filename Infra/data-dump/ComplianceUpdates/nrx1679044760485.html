      <p class="p">Colorado's public health emergency leave (PHEL) requirement no longer
         applies to the flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and similar respiratory illnesses,
         according to guidance issued by the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE).
         Beginning <span class="ph strong">January 8, 2023</span>, the PHEL requirement applies to
         COVID-19 only.</p>

      <section class="section" id="nrx1679044760485__section_ax1_chl_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">By way of background, all employers in Colorado must provide up to 80 hours of public
            health emergency leave (PHEL). Beginning November 11, 2022, PHEL covered not only
            COVID-19 related absences but also those related to RSV and the flu due to their
            inclusion in Colorado's public health emergency (PHE) declaration on that date. However,
            RSV and flu were removed from the January 8, 2023 PHE declaration, so only COVID-19 is
            covered by PHEL as of that date.</p>

         <p class="p">According to the CDLE, employees may use PHEL for a range of PHE-related needs, not just
            for confirmed cases. These needs include:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="nrx1679044760485__ul_pdq_dhl_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Symptoms of COVID-19 </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Quarantining or isolating due to exposure </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Testing for COVID-19 </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Vaccination and its side effects </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Inability to work due to health conditions that may increase susceptibility or risk
               of COVID-19 </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Needs to care for family (illness, school closure, etc.) </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Employers <span class="ph em">cannot</span> require documentation from
            employees to show that leave is for PHE-related needs, according to the CDLE
            guidance.</p>

         <p class="p">The 80-hour PHEL requirement will continue until four weeks after all applicable PHE
            declarations end or are suspended. Based on current emergency declarations, the PHEL
            requirement will continue at least into May 2023, and may extend longer if either the
            federal or the state PHE declaration is renewed further into 2023.</p>
