      <p class="p">Illinois has enacted legislation (House Bill 3582) that expands leave
         requirements and other protections under the Victims' Economic Security and Safety Act
         (VESSA). House Bill 3582 takes effect <span class="ph strong">January 1, 2022</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="vcr1672211792747__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">Currently, the VESSA requires covered employers to provide leave to employees who are victims of domestic, gender, or sexual violence or who have family or household members who are victims of such crimes.</p>
<p class="p">Employers with fewer than 15 employees must provide a total of 4 workweeks of unpaid leave. Employers with 15 to 49 employees must provide a total of 8 workweeks. Employers with 50 or more employees must provide a total of 12 workweeks.</p>
<p class="p">Currently, employees are entitled to take such leave for themselves, family members, or household members to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Seek medical attention for, or recover from, physical or psychological injuries caused by domestic or sexual violence; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Obtain services from a victim services organization; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Receive psychological or other counseling; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Participate in safety planning; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Temporarily or permanently relocate; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Take other actions to increase the safety or ensure economic security of the individual; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Seek legal assistance or remedies. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Currently, family members include a spouse, parent, son, daughter, other person related by blood or by present or prior marriage, and someone who shares a relationship through a son or daughter.</p>
<p class="p">Employers are also required to provide reasonable accommodations to individuals who have limitations because they are victims of domestic, gender, or sexual violence. In addition, employers are prohibited from discriminating against individuals because of their actual or perceived status as a victim of violence, they took or requested leave, attended a court proceeding related to the crime, or they requested a reasonable accommodation.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Reasons for Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">House Bill 3582 amends the VESSA to also entitle employees to take such leave if they
            are victims of <span class="q">“any other crime of violence,”</span> which includes the following crimes
            under the state's Criminal Code:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Homicide </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Sexual offenses </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Bodily harm </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Harassment and obscene communications </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Terrorism </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Armed violence </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Definition of Family/Household
            Members:</span></p>

         <p class="p">House Bill 3582 also amends and expands the definition of covered family and household
            members. Beginning January 1, 2022, covered family and household members will include
            a:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Spouse or party to a civil union; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Parent; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Grandparent; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Child; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Grandchild; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Sibling; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Any other person related by blood or by present or prior marriage or civil union, or
               who shares a relationship through a child, or any other individual whose close
               association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Certification:</span></p>

         <p class="p">House Bill 3582 amends and clarifies the law's certification provisions. In general,
            employers may require the employee to provide certification to the employer that:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employee or the employee's family or household member is a victim of domestic,
               sexual or gender violence, or any other crime of violence; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The leave is for one of the purposes covered by the law. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">An employee may satisfy the certification requirement by providing a
            sworn statement, and <span class="ph em">if the employee has possession of one of the
               following documents</span>, the employee must provide it:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Documentation from an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim services
               organization, an attorney, a member of the clergy, or a medical or other professional
               from whom the employee or the employee's family or household member has sought
               assistance; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A police or court record; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Other corroborating evidence. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The employee may choose which document to submit, and the employer is prohibited from
            requesting or requiring that more than one document be submitted during the same
            12-month period leave is requested or taken if the reason for leave is related to the
            same incident of violence or the same perpetrator of the violence.</p>

         <p class="p">Other Changes:</p>

         <p class="p">House Bill 3582 also extends the nondiscrimination provisions to include victims of any
            other crime of violence.</p>

         <p class="p">Employees are also entitled to a reasonable accommodation for limitations related to
            being a victim of domestic, sexual or gender violence, or any other crime of violence or
            a family or household member being a victim of the same. Accommodations may include:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">An adjustment to a job structure, workplace facility, or work requirement, including
               a transfer, reassignment, modified schedule, or leave; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A changed telephone number or seating assignment; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Installation of a lock, or implementation of a safety procedure; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Assistance in documenting an incident that occurs at the workplace or in
               work-related settings; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Any other reasonable accommodation in response to actual or threatened domestic,
               sexual, or gender violence, or any other crime of violence. </span></li>

         </ul>
