      <p class="p">Arkansas has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 555) that amends the state's law concerning
         transportation and storage of firearms by employees in employers' parking lots. Senate Bill
         555 takes effect on <span class="ph strong">July 29, 2021</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wkz1672211787255__section_N1004D_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">Under existing law, private employers are generally prohibited from barring an employee from transporting or storing a legally owned handgun in the employee's private motor vehicle in the employer's parking lot when the handgun:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Is lawfully possessed; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Stored out of sight inside a locked private motor vehicle; and </span></li>

Thus, effective July 29, 2021, employers are prohibited from barring an employee from transporting or storing a legally owned firearm in the employee's private motor vehicle in the employer's parking lot when the firearm is:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Lawfully possessed; and </span></li>
