      <p class="p">President Biden has announced a plan that would require many employers to mandate COVID-19 vaccination or weekly testing as well as provide paid leave in certain circumstances. The plan also makes changes to federal loan programs for businesses impacted by the pandemic.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Vaccine/Testing Mandate:</h2><p class="p">President Biden announced that the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is developing a rule that would require all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are fully vaccinated or produce a negative test result once a week prior to coming to work. OSHA intends to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to implement the requirements, which would allow the rule to take effect quickly.</p>
<div class="note note"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Separately, vaccination requirements will also apply to employees in healthcare settings at Medicare and Medicaid participating hospitals and other healthcare settings that receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement.</p>
</div>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Federal Employees and Contractors:</h2><p class="p">President Biden's executive order requires COVID-19 vaccination for all federal employees and all contractors that do business with the federal government.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Leave Requirement:</h2><p class="p">OSHA plans to include in the ETS a rule that would require employers with more than 100 employees to provide paid time off for the time it takes for workers to get vaccinated or to recover from side effects of the vaccination.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Forgiveness:</h2><p class="p">Under Biden's plan, the Small Business Administration (the SBA) will make it easier for more employers to apply for forgiveness of PPP loans of $150,000 or less. In a streamlined process, called <a class="xref" href="https://directforgiveness.sba.gov/requests/borrower/login/?next=/" target="_blank">direct forgiveness</a>, the SBA sends a pre-completed application form to the borrower who can review, sign, and send back to the SBA. The SBA then works with the lender to complete the forgiveness process. Under existing rules, the PPP loan must have been obtained through a lender that has opted into the direct forgiveness program for employers to take advantage of direct forgiveness. Details about how more employers would be given access to the program have yet to be released.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Program:</h2><p class="p">The SBA plans to increase the maximum amount a small business can borrow through the COVID-19 EIDL program from $500,000 to $2 million. These funds can be used to hire and retain employees, purchase inventory and equipment, and pay off higher-interest debt. The SBA also plans to make it easier for small businesses with multiple locations in hard-hit sectors like restaurants, hotels, and gyms to access these loans. The loans under the EIDL program must be repaid, but small businesses would have two years before they must begin repaying the loan. The SBA plans to offer a 30-day exclusive window for small businesses seeking loans of $500,000 or less to receive awards after the revamped program launches.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">An overview of President Biden's full plan is available <a class="xref" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/" target="_blank">here</a>. Employers should watch for developments closely. The proposed changes, if finalized, may be implemented quickly, and some could face legal challenges. Keep in mind the federal plan may prompt more states and local jurisdictions to implement similar vaccine/testing and leave requirements, some of which may cover smaller employers, if they haven't done so already.</p>
