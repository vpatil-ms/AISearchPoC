However, due to the pandemic, the DHS had offered employers some flexibility. Specifically, until July 31, 2023, the requirement that employers inspect the I-9 documentation in-person applies only to those employees who physically report to work at a company location on any regular, consistent, or predictable basis, according to the DHS. If employees work exclusively in a remote setting due to COVID-19-related precautions, they are temporarily exempt from the physical inspection requirements until they go back into the workplace on a regular, consistent, or predictable basis, or July 31, 2023, whichever is earlier.</p>

      <section class="section" id="rop1684314544664__section_N100F3_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Deadline for in-person document review is set for August 30, 2023.</h2><p class="p">With the flexible option ending on July 31, 2023, employers will have until August 30, 2023 to perform all required in-person physical examinations of documents for those individuals who have only received a virtual or remote examination under the flexible option, according to the DHS.</p>
<p class="p">Once acceptable documents have been physically inspected, the employer should add <span class="q">“documents physically examined”</span> with the date of inspection to the Section 2 additional information field on the Form I-9, or to Section 3 as appropriate. Employers should enter <span class="q">“COVID-19”</span> as the reason for the physical inspection delay, according to the <a class="xref" href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-examples-related-to-temporary-covid-19-policies" target="_blank">DHS instructions</a>.</p>
<p class="p">The instructions state that if the person who performed the remote inspection also performs the physical inspection, they should indicate the date they physically examined the documents then add their initials in the additional information field. If the person who performed the remote inspection cannot also perform the physical inspection, the person who performs the physical inspection should indicate the date they physically examined the documents as well as their full name and title in the additional information field.</p>
<p class="p">Employers may designate an authorized representative to fill out the I-9 on behalf of the employer. If an authorized representative fills out the I-9 on behalf on the employer, the employer is still liable for any violations in connection with the form or the verification process. As such, employers that use an authorized representative should ensure that they are properly trained on the I-9 process.</p>

         <p class="p">If you have employees who have only received a virtual or remote examination of I-9
            documents under the flexible option, make sure you complete in-person physical
            examinations and annotate their I-9s by August 30, 2023. The DHS has also proposed a
            rule that would allow alternative procedures for the inspection of I-9 documents. Watch
            for developments closely.</p>
