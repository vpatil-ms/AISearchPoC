      <p class="p">The City of Los Angeles has enacted an ordinance that will require large
         employers in the retail sector to follow certain scheduling practices. The ordinance takes
         effect <span class="ph strong">April 1, 2023</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ftw1679051361381__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Covered Employers</span></p>
<p class="p">To be covered by the ordinance, an employer must be identified as a retail business in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) within the retail trade categories and subcategories 44 through 45, and employ at least 300 employees globally.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Covered Employees</span></p>
<p class="p">To be covered by the ordinance, an employee must be entitled to the minimum wage under state law and perform at least two hours of work within the geographic boundaries of Los Angeles for a covered employer.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Good Faith Estimate</span></p>
<p class="p">Before hiring an employee, a covered employer must provide the employee with a written good faith estimate of the employee's work schedule.</p>
<p class="p">The estimate must notify a new employee of their rights under the ordinance. In the alternative,
            the employer may provide the new employee with a copy of the poster required by the
            ordinance (see the Notice and Recordkeeping section below).</p>
<p class="p">Employers must also provide a written good faith estimate of an employee's work schedule within ten days of an employee's request.</p>
<p class="p">If an employee's actual work hours substantially deviate from the good faith estimate, an employer must have a documented, legitimate business reason, unknown at the time the estimate was provided, to substantiate the deviation.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Right to Request Schedule Changes</span></p>
<p class="p">Covered employees have the right to request a preference for certain hours, times or locations of work. An employer may accept or decline the request, provided that the employer notifies the employee in writing of the reason for any denial.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Advance Notice of Schedule</span></p>
<p class="p">Covered employers must provide written notice of the employees' work schedule at least 14 calendar days before the start of the work period by any one of the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Post the work schedule in a conspicuous and accessible location where employee notices are customarily posted and visible to all employees; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Transmit the work schedule by electronic means or another manner reasonably determined to provide actual notice to each employee. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Changes to the Work Schedule</span></p>
<p class="p">Covered employers must provide written notice of any employer-initiated changes to the work schedule that occur after the advance notice required. An employee has a right to decline any hours, shifts or work location changes not included in the work schedule. If an employee voluntarily consents to work hours or shift changes not included in the work schedule, the consent must be in writing.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Right to Additional Hours</span></p>
<p class="p">Before hiring a new employee or using a contractor, temporary service or staffing agency to perform work, the employer must first offer the work to current employees if:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">One or more of the current employees is qualified to do the work as reasonably determined by the employer; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The additional work hours would not result in the payment of a premium rate under state law. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">An employer must make the offer to each current employee either in writing or by posting the offer in a conspicuous location in the workplace where notices to employees are customarily posted. The offer must be made at least 72-hours prior to hiring any new employee, using a contractor, temporary service or staffing agency. Upon receipt of the offer, an employee has 48-hours to accept the offer of additional hours in writing.</p>
<p class="p">An employee who accepts additional hours pursuant to this section isn't entitled to predictability pay (see below) for those additional hours, if it results in a schedule change from the work schedule.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Predictability Pay</span></p>
<p class="p">When an employee has agreed to a change in their work schedule after the advance notice period, the employer must compensate the employee with one additional hour of pay at their regular rate for each change to a scheduled date, time or location that:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Doesn't result in a loss of time to the employee; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Does result in additional work time that exceeds 15 minutes. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">An employer must compensate an employee at one-half of their regular rate of pay for the time the employee doesn't work, if the employer reduces work time listed in the work schedule by at least 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="p">Predictability pay isn't required if:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">An employee initiates the requested work schedule change. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employee accepts a schedule change initiated by an employer due to an absence of another scheduled employee. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employee accepts an offer of additional hours as stated above. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employee's hours are reduced due to the employee's violation of any existing law or of the employer's lawful policies and procedures. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employer's operations are compromised pursuant to law or force majeure. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Extra hours worked require the payment of an overtime premium under California Labor Code Section 510. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Rest Between Shifts</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers are prohibited from scheduling an employee to work a shift that starts less than ten hours from the employee's last shift without the employee's written consent. An employer must pay a premium of time and a half for each shift not separated by at least ten hours.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Notice and Recordkeeping</span></p>
<p class="p">Covered employers must post a notice published each year by the city, informing employees of their rights under the ordinance. Covered employers must post the notice in English, Spanish, Chinese (Cantonese and Mandarin), Hindi, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Armenian, Russian and Farsi, and any other language spoken by at least five percent of the employees at the workplace or job site.</p>
<p class="p">Covered employers must also retain all records required by the ordinance, for both current and former employees, for a period of three years. These records include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Work schedules for all employees; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Copies of written offers to employees for additional work hours and written responses from employees; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Written correspondence between the employer and employee regarding work schedule changes including, but not limited to, requests, approvals and denials; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Good faith estimates of hours provided to new and existing employees; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Any other records the city may require to demonstrate compliance with the ordinance. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Retaliation Prohibited</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers are prohibited from taking adverse action against any employee in retaliation for exercising rights protected under the ordinance. These rights include, but are not limited to, the right to file a complaint or inform any person about any alleged noncompliance with the ordinance; and the right to inform any person of their potential rights under the ordinance and to assist them in asserting such rights.</p>
