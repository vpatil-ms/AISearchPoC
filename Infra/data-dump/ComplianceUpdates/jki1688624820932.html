      <p class="p">Minnesota has enacted legislation (House File 2) that will create a paid family and medical leave program in the state. Contributions to the program and wage-replacement benefits will begin January 1, 2026. Employers can opt to have a private plan to meet the requirements, provided the plan is approved by the state. Effective July 1, 2024, employers are to begin submitting electronic quarterly wage-detail reports to the commissioner. ADP is currently assessing the impact these requirements will have on our products and services and will communicate an update to clients in the future.</p>
