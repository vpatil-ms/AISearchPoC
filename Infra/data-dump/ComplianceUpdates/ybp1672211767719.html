      <p class="p">Pittsburgh has enacted an ordinance that will require all employers in the city to provide
         paid sick leave to employees. The law takes effect <span class="ph strong">March 15, 2020</span>.</p>

      <p class="p">Update <span class="ph strong">February 15, 2020:</span>
         <span class="ph em">Pittsburgh recently released guidance concerning its paid sick leave
            ordinance. Among other things, the guidance provides the following
         clarifications:</span></p>

      <ul class="ul">
         <li><span class="li">Employees begin accruing sick time on March 15, 2020. Hours worked prior to this date will not count towards accrual.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li">Employers that currently provide paid vacation, sick or other leave that meets or exceeds the ordinance's requirements are not required to provide additional time.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li">All employees (regardless of their work location) must be counted when determining accrual rates. However, only employees who have worked at least 35 hours in a calendar year in Pittsburgh will be entitled to paid sick leave.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li">Employees whose job duties include regularly driving through Pittsburgh but never stopping in the City (such as trucks drivers) are covered on the law. Such time is considered time performing work within the City.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li">A new employer that <span class="q">“acquires”</span> a business must uphold all previously earned sick time by employees who remain employed.</span></li>

         <li><span class="li">Covered employees include those who transfer locations under the same employer <span class="ph em">within</span>, not outside, the City. </span></li>

      </ul>

      <section class="section" id="ybp1672211767719__section_N10080_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Covered Employers:</h2><p class="p">The ordinance applies to all employers who do business in the city. Employers with 15 or more
            employees must provide paid sick leave. Employers with fewer than 15 employees may
            provide <span class="ph em">unpaid</span> sick leave up to March 15, 2021, and then must
            provide paid sick leave thereafter.</p>
<p class="p">To calculate the number of employees, employers should count all employees, excluding the owner(s).</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="ybp1672211767719__section_N10092_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Covered Employees:</h2><p class="p">Employees who work at least 35 hours within the geographic boundaries of the City in a calendar year are covered. Only work performed within the City is required to be included when computing accrued sick time. Employers must allow a covered employee to use previously earned sick time after the employee transfers to a separate division, entity, or location for the same employer outside the city of Pittsburgh.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="ybp1672211767719__section_N1009C_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Accrual and Cap:</h2><p class="p">Employees may begin accruing sick leave on March 15, 2020, or their date of hire, whichever occurs later. Employees are entitled to accrue sick leave at a rate of one hour for every 35 hours worked for the employer in Pittsburgh. Employers with 15 or more employees may cap accrual at 40 hours. Employers with fewer than 15 employees may cap accrual at 24 hours.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ybp1672211767719__section_N100A6_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Carryover:</h2><p class="p">Accrued, unused sick leave must be carried over to the following year, unless the employer frontloads the leave (provides employees with the sick time they are entitled to at the start of each calendar year).</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="ybp1672211767719__section_N100B0_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Use:</h2><p class="p">New employees may be required to wait until their 90th calendar day of employment to use accrued sick leave. Existing employees may use sick leave as it accrues.</p>
<p class="p">Covered employees may use sick time in hourly increments or the smallest increment that the employer's payroll system uses to account for absences or use of other time. Employees are not required to find a replacement to cover sick time hours.</p>
<p class="p">Sick leave may be used for the following purposes:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">An employee's or a family member's mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employee's or a family member's medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employee's or a family member's preventive medical care;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The closure of the employee's workplace or their child's school or daycare due to a public health emergency; and</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">A family member is defined as:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A biological, adopted or foster child, stepchild or legal ward, a child of a domestic partner, or a child to whom the employee stands in place of a parent;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A biological, foster, adoptive, or step-parent, or legal guardian of an employee or an employee's spouse or domestic partner or a person who stood in place of a parent when the employee was a minor child;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A domestic partner or spouse;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A grandparent or a grandparent's spouse or domestic partner;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A grandchild;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A biological, foster, or adopted sibling; and</span></li>

         </ul>

Employees should make a reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick time so that it does not unduly disrupt employer operations.</p>
<p class="p">When the leave is foreseeable, employers may require reasonable advance notice, not to exceed seven days. In the absence of specific employer rule, notification at least one hour prior to a shift is generally sufficient. If advanced notice isn't feasible, employees must provide noticed as soon as possible.</p>
