      <section class="section" id="jun1702546996352__section_b3f_pjp_tzb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The scope of SB 525 is extensive and includes nearly all healthcare facilities operating
            in California including hospitals, licensed skilled nursing facilities, licensed home
            health agency, and all types of clinics (e.g.; medical, psychology, urgent care).</p>

         <p class="p">However, SB 525 does not cover hospitals owned, controlled, or operated by the
            Department of State or tribal clinics exempt from licensure, or an outpatient setting
            conducted, maintained or operated by a federally recognized Indian tribe, tribal
            organization or urban Indian organization.</p>

         <p class="p">The workers covered under SB 525 include employees performing work in the occupation of
            a nurse, physician, caregiver, medical resident, intern or fellow, patient care
            technician, janitor, housekeeping staff person, groundskeeper, guard, clerical worker,
            nonmanagerial administrative worker, food service worker, gift shop worker, technical
            and ancillary services worker, medical coding and medical billing personnel, scheduler,
            call center and warehouse worker, and laundry worker, regardless of formal job
            title.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Changes to Minimum Wage</p>

            dependent on the different categories of healthcare facilities:</p>
