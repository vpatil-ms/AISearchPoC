      <p class="p">California has enacted legislation (Assembly Bill 1867) that extends COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave to more employees in the state. Assembly Bill 1867 takes effect no later than 10 days after September 9, 2020. The law expires on December 31, 2020, or upon the expiration of any extension of the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act (Public Law 116-127), whichever is later.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kfi1672211776231__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The federal <a class="xref" href="https://sbshrs.adpinfo.com/covid19-stimulus-package" target="_blank">Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)</a> requires employers with fewer than 500 employees to provide emergency paid sick leave to employees who are unable to work (or telework) because of certain reasons related to COVID-19. Under the federal law, employers of healthcare providers and emergency responders may exclude these employees from emergency paid sick leave. The FFCRA is in effect from April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, unless extended.</p>
<p class="p">In April, Governor Gavin Newsom signed <a class="xref" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/4.16.20-EO-N-51-20.pdf" target="_blank">Executive Order N-51-20</a> entitling food-sector
            workers to COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave (SPSL), provided they work for an
            entity with 500 or more employees nationwide.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kfi1672211776231__section_N10063_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Assembly Bill 1867:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Among other things, Assembly Bill 1867 codifies the COVID-19 SPSL
            requirements for food-sector workers and extends the requirements to additional
            workers.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Expanded Coverage:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Assembly Bill 1867 extends the COVID-19 SPSL entitlement to all
            individuals who are:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Employed by a hiring entity with 500 or more employees in the United
               States; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employed as a health care provider or emergency responder by a
               hiring entity that has elected to exclude such employees from the FFCRA's emergency
               paid sick leave requirements. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Amount of COVID-19 SPSL:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Under Assembly Bill 1867, covered workers are entitled to up to 80 hours
            of COVID-19 SPSL if they're either considered full time or worked or were scheduled to
            work on average at least 40 hours per week in the two weeks preceding the date of
            leave.</p>

         <p class="p">Part-time employees are generally entitled to the total number of hours
            they're normally scheduled to work over two weeks. There are special rules for part-time
            employees who work variable schedules and for firefighters. See the <a class="xref" href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1867" target="_blank">text of the law</a> for details.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Use of COVID-19 SPSL:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Covered workers may use COVID-19 SPSL for when they're:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Subject to a federal, state, or local quarantine or isolation order
               related to COVID-19. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine or self-isolate
               due to concerns related to COVID-19. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prohibited from working by the covered worker's hiring entity due to
               health concerns related to the potential transmission of COVID-19. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Employers must make leave available to covered workers for immediate use
            upon an oral or written request.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Pay During Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Each hour of COVID-19 SPSL must be compensated at a rate equal to or
            greater than the highest of the:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Worker's regular rate of pay for the last pay period; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">State minimum wage; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Local minimum wage to which the covered worker is entitled. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">However, each worker's COVID-19 SPSL is subject to a cap of $511 per day
            and $5,110 total.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Notice:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers are required to post a notice regarding COVID-19 SPSL. A model
            notice for covered food sector employers is available <a class="xref" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/COVID-19-Food-Sector-Workers-poster.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and other covered employers <a class="xref" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/COVID-19-Non-Food-Sector-Employees-poster.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. For workers who don't frequent a
            workplace, an employer may satisfy this requirement by disseminating the notice
            electronically, such as by e-mail.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers must also provide employees with information on the amount of
            COVID-19 SPSL they have available on either itemized wage statements or a separate
            notice provided each payday. This requirement won't be enforced until the next full pay
            period following enactment.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Interplay with Other Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">COVID-19 SPSL is in addition to any paid sick leave that the covered
            employee receives under <a class="xref" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=246.&amp;lawCode=LAB" target="_blank">Labor Code Section 246</a>. Employers are
            prohibited from requiring an employee to use any other paid or unpaid leave in place of
            COVID-19 SPSL.</p>

         <p class="p">If an employer already provides a covered worker with paid leave that is
            payable for the reasons listed above and that would compensate the covered worker in an
            amount equal to or greater than the amount required for COVID-19 SPSL, the employer may
            count those hours toward the total number of hours of COVID-19 SPSL. Under this
            provision, the other paid leave may not include paid sick leave to which the employee is
            entitled under <a class="xref" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=246.&amp;lawCode=LAB" target="_blank">Labor Code Section 246</a>.</p>
