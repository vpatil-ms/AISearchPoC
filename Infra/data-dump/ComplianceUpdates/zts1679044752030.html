      <p class="p">Westchester County and Ithaca, New York have joined New York City in requiring employers to provide greater wage transparency.</p>

      <section class="section" id="zts1679044752030__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2>
         <p class="p">The New York City Council enacted a pay transparency law, which requires
            New York City employers to include the minimum and maximum starting salary for
            advertised jobs, promotions or transfer opportunities beginning <span class="ph strong">November 1, 2022</span>.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Additional Jurisdictions Join in Requiring Wage
               Transparency:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Westchester County and Ithaca, New York have joined New York City in enacting wage
            transparency laws:</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Westchester County:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Westchester County employers will be prohibited from advertising a job,
            promotion or transfer opportunity without also including the minimum and maximum salary
            for the job, promotion, or transfer in the job posting or advertisement beginning <span class="ph strong">November 6, 2022</span>.</p>

         <p class="p">Under the <a class="xref" href="https://westchestercountyny.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;ID=10917730&amp;GUID=6BB79D87-02B9-48F0-995D-FA1E9940A0E4" target="_blank">amended Human Rights Law</a>:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="zts1679044752030__ul_gcw_r2k_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">The requirements apply to postings for positions that are required to be performed,
               in whole or in part, in Westchester County, whether in an office, in the field or
               remotely. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Wage range is defined as the lowest to highest salary that an employer in good faith
               believes it would, at the time of the posting, pay for the position. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Job posting is defined as a written or printed communication, whether electronic or
               hard copy, where the employer is recruiting and accepting applications for a
               particular role. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The amendment also specifically excludes general requests for applications, if the
            requests only indicate that an employer is accepting applications without reference to a
            particular role, such as a help wanted sign.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Ithaca:</span></p>
<p class="p">Ithaca employers with four or more employees must disclose the minimum and
            maximum hourly or salary compensation for an employment opportunity, such as a job,
            promotion, or transfer opportunity, in job postings, beginning <span class="ph strong">September 1, 2022</span>.</p>
<p class="p">The <a class="xref" href="https://ecode360.com/8390481" target="_blank">amended Human Rights Ordinance</a> will make it an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employment agency or employer (or their employees or agents) to advertise an employment opportunity without stating the minimum and maximum hourly or salary compensation that the employer in good faith believes at the time of posting it would pay for the advertised job, promotion or transfer opportunity..</p>
