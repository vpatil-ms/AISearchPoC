               member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition. </span></li>

               qualifying exigency arising out of a family member's deployment as a service member.
            </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">A covered individual is eligible for a maximum of 12 weeks of paid leave in a year. To
            comply with the law, an employer can provide paid leave benefits by:</p>

                        requirements only. Employers with 25 or more employees are covered by all
                        the leave requirements. Employers with fewer than 10 employees and employers

                           <span class="q">“primarily”</span> in Delaware if they spend at least 60 percent of their
                        working hours in Delaware.</p>

                     <p class="p">To determine whether the 10-employee and 25-employee thresholds are met, the
                        employer should start by counting every single Delaware employee, regardless
                        of how long they've worked or how many hours a week they work. Then subtract
                        the employees on waivers (see below). From there, add in any employees the
                        employer has reclassified (see below). The Delaware Paid Leave
                        administrative system will help employers keep track of their employee
                        count.</p>

                     <p class="p">Once a new level of coverage has been achieved, employees will retain those
                        benefits for at least the next 12 months, even if the employer's employee
                        count falls below the threshold number. Only after continuously staying
                        below the employee threshold number for over 12 months will the employer be
                        allowed to drop the now-no-longer required coverages.</p>

                        employer, utilizing the recommendation of the Division of Paid Leave's
                        administrative system, will make the initial decision as to whether an
                        employee's application qualifies for leave, the dollar amount of the benefit
                        payment and how long the employee will be allowed to remain on paid
                        leave.</p>

                        two possible exceptions: (1) employees who are assigned to Delaware teams
                        but telecommute; (2) Delaware employees who are on temporary assignment out

                        on DPL's portal), these employees can join the plan. If, at some later date,
                        the employer and employee agree that the employee shouldn't be part of the
                        plan, they can sign a declassification form to leave the plan.</p>
