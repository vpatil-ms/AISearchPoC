      <p class="p">California has announced an increase to the pay rates computer software
         employees and physicians must receive in order to be exempt from overtime. The minimum
         salary required for the administrative, professional, and executive overtime exemptions in
         the state will also increase. These new rates take effect on <span class="ph strong">January 1, 2021</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="frr1672211779748__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Computer software employees and physicians:</span></p>
<p class="p">Under California Labor Code Sections 515.5 and 515.6, computer software employees and physicians are exempt from the state's overtime requirements if they meet specific duties requirements and earn a minimum pay rate. These pay thresholds are adjusted annually for inflation.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Administrative, executive, and professional
               employees:</span></p>
<p class="p">California also has exemptions for bona fide administrative, professional, and executive employees. To be exempt from overtime, these employees must meet certain state salary and duties tests. Their salary must be at least twice the state minimum hourly wage based on full-time employment of 40 hours per week. Since the state's minimum hourly wage will increase on January 1, 2021, the minimum salary thresholds for these exemptions will also increase.</p>
