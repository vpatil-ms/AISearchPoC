      <p class="p">The California Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) has revised emergency rules related to protecting workers from COVID-19. The revisions are effective immediately.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jkj1672211788924__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">In late 2020, the DIR adopted emergency rules for protecting workers from COVID-19, including a requirement for employers to adopt a written prevention program. Under the emergency rules, employers must establish, implement, and maintain an effective, written COVID-19 Prevention Program, which may be integrated into the employer's Injury and Illness Program, or be maintained in a separate document.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jkj1672211788924__section_N10052_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Key Changes:</h2><p class="p">The revised rules reflect the state's latest COVID-19 public health guidance and include changes to face coverings and physical distancing requirements. Here's a summary of some of the changes that impact employers:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Face coverings.</span> Employers may
               generally allow fully vaccinated employees not to wear face coverings indoors, but
               they must document the employees' vaccination status. However, there are some
               settings where the California Department of Public Health requires face coverings
               regardless of vaccination status. In outbreaks, all employees must wear face
               coverings indoors and outdoors when six-feet physical distancing cannot be
               maintained, regardless of vaccination status. Employers may not retaliate against
               employees for wearing face coverings. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Physical distancing and barriers.</span>
               There are no longer physical distancing or barrier requirements regardless of
               employee vaccination status with certain exceptions, such as:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">Employers must evaluate whether it's necessary to implement
                     physical distancing and barriers during an outbreak (three or more cases in an
                     exposed group of employees); and </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Employers must implement physical distancing and barriers
                     during a major outbreak (20 or more cases in an exposed group of employees).
                  </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Respirators.</span> Employers must provide
               unvaccinated employees with approved respirators for voluntary use when working
               indoors or in a vehicle with others, upon request. A respirator is defined as a
               respiratory protection device approved by the National Institute for Occupational
               Safety and Health (NIOSH) to protect the wearer from particulate matter, such as an
               N95. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Close contacts.</span> Fully vaccinated
               employees don't need to be tested or quarantined after close contacts with COVID-19
               cases unless they have symptoms. Employers must exclude, from the workplace,
               employees who have COVID-19 symptoms and/or are not fully vaccinated and, if that
               close contact is work-related, continue to pay the employee. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Ventilation.</span> Employers must review the
                  <a class="xref" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Interim-Guidance-for-Ventilation-Filtration-and-Air-Quality-in-Indoor-Environments.aspx" target="_blank">Interim guidance for Ventilation, Filtration, and
                  Air Quality in Indoor Environments</a>, evaluate ventilation systems to
               maximize outdoor air and increase filtrations efficiency, and evaluate the use of
               additional air cleaning systems. </span></li>
