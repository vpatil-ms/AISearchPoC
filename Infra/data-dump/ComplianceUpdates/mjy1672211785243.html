      <p class="p">The New Jersey Supreme Court has clarified the scope of the state's Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA).</p>

      <section class="section" id="mjy1672211785243__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2>
         
         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">PWFA:</span></p>

         <p class="p">In 2014 New Jersey's PWFA amended the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD) by
            adding <span class="q">“pregnancy or breastfeeding”</span> as a protected class under the LAD. Among other
            things, the PWFA prohibits employers from:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for pregnant or breastfeeding
               employees; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Treating pregnant or breastfeeding employees unequally or unfavorably; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Penalizing pregnant or breastfeeding employees who request accommodation. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Light Duty Work:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers may need to reasonably accommodate an employee by providing light-duty work in
            certain circumstances, such as when an employee is temporarily unable to perform their
            regular job duties due to pregnancy. Light work duty generally means assigning a worker
            to alternate work that is physically or mentally less demanding than their regular job
            duties.</p>

      <section class="section" id="mjy1672211785243__section_N10075_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Case Background:</h2><p class="p">In <a class="xref" href="https://www.njcourts.gov/attorneys/assets/opinions/supreme/a_68_19.pdf?c=QRP" target="_blank">Delanoy v. Township of Ocean</a>, a pregnant police officer brought a discrimination claim against her employer based on differences in two standard operating procedures (SOPs) for <span class="q">“light duty”</span> work (a maternity SOP for pregnant employees and a light duty SOP for non-pregnant employees).</p>
<p class="p">The maternity SOP required a return from light duty work no more than 45 days after the officer's due date, whereas the light duty SOP relied on their doctor's projected return to work date. Additionally, under the light duty SOP, the police chief had discretion to waive the requirement to exhaust accumulated paid leave. The maternity SOP did not have an equivalent provision.</p>
<p class="p">Delanoy filed a lawsuit under the PWFA, alleging unfavorable treatment because she was required to use her leave time in connection with her light-duty work, whereas her male colleagues were not required to do so.</p>

      <section class="section" id="mjy1672211785243__section_N10090_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Court Decision:</h2><p class="p">On March 9, 2021, New Jersey's Supreme Court ruled that although the purpose of both SOPs was to accommodate light duty work, the leave provisions under the maternity SOP were stricter than those of the light duty SOP, which violated the PWFA's prohibition on unfavorable treatment of pregnant employees.</p>
<p class="p">The Court found that a pregnant employee's temporary inability to perform an essential function of their job will not automatically establish undue hardship, and the employer has the burden of establishing such hardship.</p>
