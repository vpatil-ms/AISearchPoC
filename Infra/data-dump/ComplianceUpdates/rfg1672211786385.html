      <p class="p">The Department of Labor (DOL) has published a final rule that withdraws changes to the test for determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The changes were scheduled to take effect May 7, 2021.</p>

      <section class="section" id="rfg1672211786385__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The DOL has traditionally used an <span class="q">“<a class="xref" href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs13.pdf" target="_blank">economic realities</a>”</span> test to determine whether workers are covered by
            the FLSA and subject to minimum wage, overtime, and other wage and hour rules. This test
            looks at the following factors, each carrying equal weight:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The extent to which the services rendered are an integral part of the principal's business. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The permanency of the relationship. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The amount of the alleged contractor's investment in facilities and equipment. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The nature and degree of control by the principal. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The alleged contractor's opportunities for profit and loss. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The amount of initiative, judgment, or foresight in open market competition with others required for the contractor's success. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The degree of independent business organization and operation. </span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="rfg1672211786385__section_N1007A_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Withdrawn Changes:</h2><p class="p">Put forward by the Trump Administration, the now withdrawn changes would have defined and clarified how the economic realities test is applied. Specifically, the changes would have sharpened the test into five distinct factors, including:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Two <span class="ph strong"><span class="q">“core
                  factors”</span></span> that would have carried more weight in the analysis (the nature
               and degree of the worker's control over the work and the worker's opportunity for
               profit or loss based on initiative and/or investment). </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Three other factors</span> would have served
               as additional guideposts in the analysis: the amount of skill required for the work;
               the degree of permanence of the working relationship between the worker and the
               potential employer; and whether the work is part of an integrated unit of production. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">These and other changes to the independent contractor test for the FLSA are withdrawn and will not go into effect. The DOL said it is withdrawing the changes because:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">They would have been in tension with the FLSA's text and purpose, as well as relevant judicial precedent. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The prioritization of two <span class="q">“core factors”</span> for determining employee status under the FLSA would have undermined the longstanding balancing approach of the economic realities test and court decisions requiring a review of the totality of the circumstances related to the employment relationship. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">They would have narrowed the facts and considerations comprising the analysis whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor, resulting in workers losing FLSA protections. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="rfg1672211786385__section_N100A9_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">Employers should remember that the FLSA and other laws have different tests to determine whether a worker is an independent contractor, and some states have their own independent contractor tests. Before classifying and treating any individual as an independent contractor, perform all applicable tests and consult legal counsel if needed.</p>
