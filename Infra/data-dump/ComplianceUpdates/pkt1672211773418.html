      <p class="p">Chicago has published rules and enacted two ordinances that will expand coverage under the
         city's paid sick leave law, create new notice and recordkeeping requirements, and prohibit
         adverse action against employees because of COVID-19. The changes take effect on <span class="ph strong">July 1, 2020</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="pkt1672211773418__section_N1004D_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Expanded Paid Sick Leave Coverage:</h2><p class="p">All employers with at least one covered employee are required to provide paid sick leave, regardless of whether the employer has a worksite in the city or is subject to the city's business license requirements.</p>
<p class="p">To be considered a covered employee, the employee must work:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Within the city for at least two hours in any two-week period; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">At least 80 hours for an employer within any 120-day period. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The definition of a covered employee has also been expanded to expressly include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">An outside salesperson. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A member of a religious corporation or organization. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A student at, and employed by, an accredited Illinois college or university. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Motor carriers regulated by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation or the state. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="pkt1672211773418__section_N1007B_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Notice Requirements:</h2><p class="p">New rules make clear that employers must post a required notice about minimum wage and paid sick leave through the employer's usual methods of communication for such notices (paper posting or electronic dissemination through their internal communication channels). When posting a paper notice, the notice must be printed on and scaled to fill a sheet of paper that measures 11 inches by 17 inches.</p>
<p class="p">The new rules also require that the minimum wage and paid sick leave notice employers must provide with the first paycheck be printed on and scaled to fit a sheet of paper that measures 8.5 inches by 11 inches. However, where employees are enrolled in direct deposit but have the option to review their pay stubs electronically, employers may provide the notice through the employers' usual methods of electronic communication.</p>
<p class="p">The new rules add a requirement that the notice employers must provide with the first paycheck must also be provided annually with the first paycheck on or following July 1, whether by paper or electronic means.</p>
<p class="p">All notices must be in English and any language(s) spoken by employees at the facility who aren't proficient in English and in which the city has provided non-English language notices.</p>
