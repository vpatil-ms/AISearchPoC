      <p class="p">The District of Columbia has enacted legislation (B24-109) prohibiting employers from
         taking adverse action against an applicant or employee for the off-duty, lawful use of
         cannabis. The law also includes additional protections for medical cannabis users and a new
         notice requirement for employers.</p>

      <section class="section" id="zsp1679044753295__section_zjg_kmk_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The following changes will apply on the date their fiscal impact appears
            in the district's approved budget or 365 days after the mayor approved the law,
            whichever is later. The law was signed by the mayor on July 13, 2022.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers are prohibited from taking adverse action (e.g., terminating or
            refusing to hire an employee) based upon:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="zsp1679044753295__ul_p1j_lmk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">The individual's use of cannabis; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The individual's status as a medical cannabis program patient; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The presence of cannabinoid metabolites in the individual's bodily
               fluids in an employer-required or -requested drug test without additional factors
               indicating impairment under the law. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Exceptions:</span></p>

         <p class="p"> B24-109 states that an employer wouldn't be in violation of the law if
            they take action based on any of the following:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="zsp1679044753295__ul_q1j_lmk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">The employee is in a position designated as safety sensitive. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employer's actions are required by federal statute, federal
               regulations, or a federal contract or funding agreement. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee used, consumed, possessed, stored, delivered,
               transferred, displayed, transported, sold, purchased, or grew cannabis at their place
               of employment, while performing work for the employer, or during the employee's hours
               of work. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee is impaired by the use of cannabis — meaning the
               employee manifests specific articulable symptoms while working, or during the
               employee's hours of work, that substantially decrease or lessen the employee's
               performance of the duties or tasks of the employee's job position, or specific
               articulable symptoms interfere with an employer's obligation to provide a safe and
               healthy workplace as required by district or federal occupational safety and health
               law. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Drug-Free Workplace Policies:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The law doesn't prohibit an employer from adopting a reasonable
            drug-free workplace policy that:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="zsp1679044753295__ul_r1j_lmk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Requires post-accident or reasonable suspicion drug testing of
               employees for cannabis or other drugs or drug testing of employees in safety
               sensitive positions; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Is necessary to comply with federal law, or a federal contract or
               funding agreement, if applicable to the employer; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prohibits the use, consumption, possession, storage, delivery,
               transfer, display, transportation, sale, purchase, or growing of cannabis at the
               employee's place of employment while performing work for the employer or during the
               employee's hours of work; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prohibits employees from being impaired at the employee's place of
               employment while performing work for the employer or during the employee's hours of
               work. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Medical Cannabis:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The law clarifies that employers must treat a qualifying patient's use
            of medical marijuana to treat a disability in the same manner as it would treat the
            legal use of a controlled substance prescribed by or taken under the supervision of a
            licensed healthcare professional. This law doesn't apply if it would require an employer
            to:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="zsp1679044753295__ul_s1j_lmk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Commit a violation of a federal statute, regulation, contract or
               funding agreement; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Permit an employee to use medical marijuana while the employee is in
               or assigned to a safety sensitive position; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Allow the use of medical marijuana in a smokable form at a location
               the employer owns, uses, or controls. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">New Notice Requirement:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must provide notice to employees of their rights under the
            law, whether the employer has designated the employee's position as safety sensitive,
            and the protocols for any testing for alcohol or drugs that the employer performs. The
            notice must be provided:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="zsp1679044753295__ul_t1j_lmk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Within 60 days after the applicability date and on an annual basis
               thereafter to all existing employees; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Upon hire of a new employee. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The Office of Human Rights (OHR) will publish a sample notice.</p>
