      <p class="p">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has ruled that using the fluctuating workweek method to calculate overtime pay violates the Pennsylvania Minimum Wage Act (<span class="q">“PMWA”</span>).</p>

      <section class="section" id="oai1672211769385__section_N1004C_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires employers to pay non-exempt
            employees an overtime premium for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek. The FLSA has
            approved certain formulas to calculate overtime pay, including the fluctuating workweek
            method which is used to determine overtime pay for salaried, non-exempt workers whose
            schedules vary week to week.</p>

         <p class="p">To use the fluctuating workweek method under the FLSA:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">An employee's hours must fluctuate from week to week (both above or below 40
               hours);</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee must receive a fixed salary each workweek, regardless of how few or
               many hours they work;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee and employer must have a clear and mutual understanding (which should
               be in writing) that the fixed salary is compensation (apart from overtime premiums)
               for the hours worked each workweek;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The salary must meet or exceed the applicable minimum wage for all hours worked in
               those workweeks in which the number of hours worked is greatest; and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee must receive overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in a
               workweek. Since the salary is intended to compensate the employee at straight time
               rates for whatever hours are worked in the workweek, the regular rate will vary from
               week to week. To obtain the regular rate, divide the number of hours worked in the
               workweek into the amount of the salary. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="oai1672211769385__section_jvy_b4j_yxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">A non-exempt employee earns a fixed salary of <span class="ph strong">$920</span> per week and works <span class="ph strong">46</span> hours in a week. The
            total amount due to is <span class="ph strong">$980</span> ($920 for the week plus $60
            overtime pay).</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="oai1672211769385__ul_evk_c4j_yxb">
            <li><span class="li">Regular Rate: ($920 per week)/ (46 hours per week) = $20 per hour </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Overtime Hours: 46 hours - 40 hours = 6 hours </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Overtime Pay: ($20 per hour) x (6 hours) x (1/2) = $60 </span></li>

General Nutrition Centers, Inc</a>., the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that calculating overtime using the fluctuating workweek method does not compensate employees one-and-a-half times their regular rate of pay for all time worked over 40 hours in a workweek, as expressly required by the PMWA.</p>
<p class="p">The court ruled that when determining overtime pay under state law, the
            employee's regular rate of pay must be multiplied by <span class="ph strong">one-and-a-half</span> for all hours worked over 40, as opposed to the one-half used in
            the fluctuating workweek method.</p>
