      <p class="p">The California Treasurer has published an emergency rule that defines key terms and clarifies employer responsibilities under the CalSavers Retirement Savings Program. The emergency rule took effect immediately.</p>

      <section class="section" id="uwy1672211801814__section_N1004C_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p"><a class="xref" href="https://www.calsavers.com/" target="_blank">CalSavers</a> is a state-based payroll withholding savings program using Roth (post-tax) individual retirement accounts. All employers with five or more employees must either register with CalSavers or offer a qualifying retirement plan.</p>

<p class="p">The emergency rule defines an eligible employer as one that:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Has five or more employees, as determined under the methodology described below, at least one of whom is an eligible employee; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Doesn't maintain or contribute to a qualifying retirement plan; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph em">Isn't</span> the federal government, the state,

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Has fewer than five employees, as determined under the methodology
               described below, <span class="ph em">or has five or more employees, but doesn't
                  employ any eligible employees</span>; </span></li>
