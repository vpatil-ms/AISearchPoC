      <p class="p">South Dakota has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 5) that amends and adds tighter restrictions to its state medical marijuana law. Senate Bill 5 takes effect on July 1, 2022.</p>

      <section class="section" id="obw1672211799181__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Current Provisions:</span></p>
<p class="p">South Dakota law allows employers to prohibit employees from using cannabis at work and from working while under its influence.</p>
<p class="p">The law also contains carveout provisions for medical marijuana users. Under the provisions, employers cannot consider a worker to be under the influence solely because a drug test detects metabolites or components of cannabis if the amounts detected are too small to cause impairment.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Definitions:</span></p>
<p class="p">A <span class="q">“Safety-sensitive job”</span> is a position with tasks or duties that an employer reasonably believes could cause the illness, injury, or death of a person or result in serious property damage.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="q">“Under the influence”</span> is an abnormal mental or physical condition that tends to deprive a person of clearness of intellect and control that they would otherwise possess due to the consumption of any degree of cannabis or cannabis products.</p>

      <section class="section" id="obw1672211799181__section_N10068_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2><p class="p">Senate Bill 5 removes the cannabis carveouts and allows employers to enforce drug-free workplace policies (including a drug-testing program). Employers may also prohibit the use, display, possession, transfer, and transport of cannabis in any workplace, and may prohibit any employee from working while under the influence.</p>
<p class="p">Senate Bill 5 also prohibits, among other things, the following actions:</p>
<p class="p">· Performing a safety-sensitive job or operating, navigating, or being in actual physical control of any motor vehicle, aircraft, train, or motorboat while under the influence; or</p>
<p class="p">· Undertaking any task under the influence of cannabis, when doing so would constitute negligence or professional malpractice.</p>
