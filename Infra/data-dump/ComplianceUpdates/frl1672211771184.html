      <p class="p">New Jersey has enacted legislation (SB 2304) to expand its earned sick leave, family leave act, and temporary disability insurance rules during a state of emergency.</p>

      <section class="section" id="frl1672211771184__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Senate Bill 2304:</h2><p class="p">The expansions under Senate Bill 2304 are covered below.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Earned Sick Leave Law Expansion:</span></p>
<p class="p">SB 2304 expands New Jersey's earned sick leave law to allow an employee to take leave due to an epidemic-related state of emergency declared by the Governor, a health official acting to contain a disease, or a determination by a health care provider, the Commissioner of Health or other public health authority that the employee's presence in the community, or the presence of an employee's family member in need of care, would <span class="q">“jeopardize the health of others.”</span></p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Family Leave Act Expansion:</span></p>
<p class="p">SB 2304 also amends the New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA), which provides unpaid, job protected leave in the event an employee needs to care for a family member with a serious health condition (among other reasons for use). The NJFLA applies to employers with 30 or more employees and provides 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 24-month period.</p>
<p class="p">SB 2304 expands the definition of <span class="q">“serious health condition”</span> during a state of emergency to include an illness caused by an epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to a communicable disease, or efforts to prevent spread of a communicable disease, which requires in-home care or treatment of an employee's family member.</p>
<p class="p">The amendments also restrict an employer's ability to exercise the highly compensated exception (which ordinarily allows leave to be denied to certain highly compensated individuals to prevent substantial economic injury to the company) and require job reinstatement rights to individuals who take such leave during an epidemic.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) Expansion:</span></p>
<p class="p">The definition of a serious health condition under New Jersey's Family Leave Insurance and TDI is also amended to be consistent with the amended definition under the NJFLA, covered above. Additionally, the one-week waiting period for TDI benefits is removed for illnesses caused by an epidemic.</p>
