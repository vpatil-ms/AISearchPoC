      <p class="p"> Effective January 1, 2024, tipped income will become taxable in the state of Montana.</p>

      <section class="section" id="oab1695880695228__section_wmr_31b_yyb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Under current law, effective through December 31, 2023, tipped income is not considered
            taxable income for Montana state income tax purposes.</p>

         <p class="p">The current version of Montana 15-30-2501 (Montana Individual Income Tax Definitions)
            states in part:</p>

         <p class="p">(b) The term (wage) does not include:</p>

         <p class="p">(i) tips and gratuities exempt from taxation under 15-30-2110.</p>

         <p class="p">The current version of 15-30-2110 (Montana Adjusted Gross Income) states in part:</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="q">“(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted gross
               income does not include the following, which are exempt from taxation under this
               chapter:”</span></p>

         <p class="p"><span class="q">“(f) all tips or gratuities that are covered by section 3402(k) or service charges
               that are covered by section 3401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.
               3402(k) or 3401, as amended and applicable on January 1, 1983, received by a person
               for services rendered to patrons of premises licensed to provide food, beverage, or
               lodging.”</span></p>

         <p class="p">As a result of the enactment of <a class="xref" href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2021/billpdf/SB0399.pdf" target="_blank">Montana
               Senate Bill 399</a> , both of these provisions are repealed effective January 1,
            2024, resulting in tipped income becoming taxable to employees for Montana state income
            tax purposes.</p>

      </section>

      <section class="section" id="oab1695880695228__section_yqy_31b_yyb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Next Steps</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Montana employers with tipped employees should notify these employees that, beginning
            January 1, 2024, tips received will be considered taxable income for Montana state
            income tax purposes and the appropriate Montana state tax will be withheld as well as
            the usual federal taxes.</p>

         <p class="p">In addition, the Montana Department of Revenue has indicated that it will be updating
            the Montana Employer and Information Agent Guide with Montana Withholding Tax Tables in
            October of 2023 and it is recommended that Montana employers review this updated
            guidance with their legal and/or tax advisors.</p>
