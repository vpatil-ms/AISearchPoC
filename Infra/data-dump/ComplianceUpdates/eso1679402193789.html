            placed in temporary roles at third-party client employers by temporary help service
            firms.</p>

            third-party client the same average rate of pay and equivalent benefits as a permanent
            employee that performs the same or similar work of the third-party client.</p>

         <p class="p">The Bill also prohibits staffing firms or a contract or agent of such, from charging a
            fee to a temporary laborer to transport them to or from the designated work site.</p>
