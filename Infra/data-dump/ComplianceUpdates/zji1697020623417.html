      <p class="p">New York has enacted legislation (Senate Bill S2518A), which prohibits employers from accessing certain electronic personal accounts. Senate Bill S2518A takes effect on March 12, 2024.</p>

      <section class="section" id="zji1697020623417__section_mq5_gbs_bzb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Senate Bill S2518A protects an employee's right to privacy for an account or profile on
            an electronic medium where users may create, share, and view user-generated content
            (personal accounts). This includes uploading or downloading videos or still photographs,
            blogs, video blogs, podcasts, instant messages, or internet website profiles or
            locations that are used by an employee or an applicant exclusively for personal
            purposes.</p>

         <p class="p">The law prohibits employers from requesting, requiring or coercing an employee or
            applicant to:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="zji1697020623417__ul_xby_hbs_bzb">
            <li><span class="li">Access the employee or applicant's personal account in the presence of the employer; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Disclose a username, password or other authentication information to access a
               personal account through an electronic communications device; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Reproduce photos, videos or other information contained within a personal account
               obtained with unlawful methods. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">However, an employer may request or require an employee to disclose access information
            to an account:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="zji1697020623417__ul_yby_hbs_bzb">
            <li><span class="li">Known to the employer to be used for business purposes; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provided by the employer that is used for business purposes, if the employee
               received notice of the employer's right to request or require the access information.
            </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Employers may also take the following actions under the law:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="zji1697020623417__ul_zby_hbs_bzb">
            <li><span class="li">Access electronic communications devices that the employer paid for (in whole or in
               part) where the provision of or payment for the device was conditioned on the
               employer's right to access the device, and the employee had notice of that right and
               explicitly agreed to such conditions. <div class="note note" id="zji1697020623417__note_acy_hbs_bzb"> 
                  <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employers are prohibited from accessing personal accounts on such devices.</p>

            <li><span class="li">Comply with a court order that requires them to obtain or provide information from
               or access to an employee's account. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Restrict or prohibit access to certain websites while an employee uses the
               employer's network or a device (paid in whole or in part) by the employer, provided
               the provision of or payment for the device was conditioned on the employer's right to
               restrict access and the employee had notice and explicitly agreed to such conditions. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">View, access or utilize information about an employee or applicant that: <ul class="ul" id="zji1697020623417__ul_ccy_hbs_bzb">

                     voluntarily shared by the employee, client or other third party that the
                     employee subject to such report or investigation has voluntarily given access
                     to contained within such employee's personal account. </span></li>
