      <p class="p">The city of Duluth, Minnesota has enacted an ordinance (File No. 21-23-0) that amends
         certain aspects of the city's paid sick leave law. The ordinance is effective <span class="ph strong">August 19, 2021</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="tzk1672211791019__section_N1004D_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">Since January 1, 2020, Duluth has required employers to provide paid sick leave to employees. The requirement generally applies to any employer with five or more employees, regardless of whether they work in the city. Employees are entitled to accrue one hour of paid sick leave for every 50 hours worked, up to 64 hours per year.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Prior to</span> the new ordinance , employees were entitled to use the
            leave for:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">An absence resulting from the employee's or a family member's: mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; need for medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or need for preventive medical care; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An absence due to domestic abuse, sexual assault, or stalking of the employee or employee's family member. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"> Employers must notify employees of the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">That employees are entitled to paid sick leave and the amount they're entitled to; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The terms of the use of such leave guaranteed under the law; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">That retaliation against employees who request or use covered leave is prohibited; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">That each employee has the right to file a written complaint to the city clerk if paid sick leave is denied or the employee is retaliated against for requesting or taking paid sick leave. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"> Prior to the new ordinance, employers were able to comply with the requirement by displaying the notice in a conspicuous location in the workplace.</p>

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Expands the reasons employees may use the leave to also include lost work hours due to closure of employee's place of employment for public health reasons. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Requires employers to, in addition to displaying the paid sick leave requirements, also provide every new employee with an individual copy of their paid sick leave policy. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Requires employers to include a copy of their paid sick leave policy in their employee handbook (if they maintain one). </span></li>
