                           each time such employee has need to express the milk. Employers are also
                           required to provide a place, other than a bathroom that is shielded from
                           view and free from intrusion from co-workers and the public, which may be
                           used by an employee to express breast milk. Under federal law, these two

         <p class="p">The break time may be unpaid unless otherwise required to be paid by federal, state or

            entirety of the break.</p>

            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>With limited exceptions, federal law requires employers to pay exempt employees their
               full salary in any workweek in which they perform any work, regardless of the
               quantity or quality of the work. As such, deductions from any exempt employees'
               salary for such breaks are prohibited.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p">As was the case prior to the amendment, employers with fewer than 50 employees are
            exempt from the requirements if they would impose an undue hardship by causing the
            employer significant difficulty or expense when considered in relation to the size,
            financial resources, nature, or structure of the employer's business. Crewmembers of air
            carriers are also exempt from the law. There are also special rules for rail carriers.
