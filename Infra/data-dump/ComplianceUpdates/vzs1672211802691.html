      <p class="p">Federal service and supply contractors that are required to maintain an affirmative action program (AAP) have until June 30, 2022 to certify their AAP via the Contractor Portal recently launched by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP).</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2><p class="p">The following federal service and supply contractors must register with and use the <a class="xref" href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/contractorportal" target="_blank">Contactor Portal</a> to certify whether they are in AAP compliance:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Those that hold a contract of $50,000 or more and employ 50 or more employees, who must develop and maintain AAPs pursuant to Executive Order 11246 and Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Those with at least 50 employees and a contract of $150,000 or more, who must also develop an AAP pursuant to the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">For current contractors, the certification is due by June 30, 2022. New contractors will have 120 days to develop their AAP and must register and certify compliance through the Contractor Portal within 90 days of developing their AAP. After the initial certification year, the OFCCP will set a date by which all existing contractors must renew their annual certification.</p>
<p class="p">Contractors can register for the Contractor Portal by creating a <a class="xref" href="https://contractorportal.dol.gov/saml/drupal_login/login_gov" target="_blank">Login.gov</a> account using an email and a secure password. To register, contractors will be required to enter their Employer Identification Number (EIN) and EEO-1 Headquarter/Company Number and Establishment/Unit Number.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Next Steps:</h2><p class="p">If you are a covered contractor, register with the Contractor Portal as soon as possible and certify your AAP status by June 30, 2022 .</p>
