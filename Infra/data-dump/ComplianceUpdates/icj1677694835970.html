      <p class="p">Georgia has enacted legislation (House Bill 389) that clarifies the test
         used to determine whether an individual is an independent contractor or employee for the
         purpose of unemployment benefits in the state. House Bill 389 takes effect <span class="ph strong">July 1, 2022</span>.</p>

                  <li><span class="li">Has been, and will continue to be, free from control or direction over the
                     performance of such services, both under the individual's contract of service

</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The individual and the services performed are the subject of an SS-8 determination
               by the Internal Revenue Service, which decided against employee status.<p class="p"> House Bill
                  389 amends the law to clarify the factors to consider when determining whether an
                  individual is free from control or direction from the employer. These factors
                  include whether the individual:</p>

                     a minimum number of orders to be obtained; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Receives only minimal instructions and no direct oversight or supervision
                     regarding the services to be performed, such as the location where the services
                     are to be performed and any requested deadlines; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">When applicable, has no territorial or geographic restrictions; and </span></li>

<p class="p">House Bill 389 also clarifies exemptions from unemployment benefits for music
                  industry professionals and individuals working for network companies. See the
