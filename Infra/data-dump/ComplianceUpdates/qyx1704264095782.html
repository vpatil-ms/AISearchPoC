      <p class="p">The California Department of Industrial Relations has updated guidance to address the expansion of the state's paid sick leave law that takes effect January 1, 2024.</p>

      <section class="section" id="qyx1704264095782__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         <p class="p subHeading1">Background</p>
<p class="p">Effective January 1, 2024, changes to the state's paid sick leave law include but aren't limited to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Employees have the right to use up to 5 days or 40 hours of paid sick leave per year (up from 3 days or 24 hours). </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">While employers are generally required to carryover accrued, unused leave to the
               following year, no carryover is required if the full amount of leave is received at
               the beginning of each year (also known as the <span class="q">“up-front method”</span> or
                  <span class="q">“frontloading”</span>). <span class="q">“Full amount of leave”</span> for these purposes is defined as
               5 days or 40 hours (up from 3 days or 24 hours). </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employer is under no obligation to allow an employee's total accrual of paid sick leave to exceed 10 days or 80 hours (up from 6 days or 48 hours), provided that an employee's rights to accrue and use paid sick leave are not otherwise limited. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Certain provisions will preempt any local ordinance to the contrary. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Updated Guidance</p>

         <p class="p">The California Department of Industrial Relations has updated its answers to <a class="xref" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/DLSE/Paid_Sick_Leave.htm" target="_blank">frequently asked questions</a> about the state's paid sick leave to address the
            changes for 2024. Here are some examples.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Q:</span> What does 5 days or 40 hours mean?</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> Starting on January 1, 2024, an employer must allow an
            employee to use at least five days or 40 hours, whichever is more (refer to <a class="xref" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/opinions/2015.08.07.pdf" target="_blank">DLSE Opinion Letter</a> 2015.08.07).</p>

         <p class="p">Therefore, for example, if an employee works 10-hour days, the employee will be entitled
            to use at a minimum 50 hours of paid sick leave.</p>

         <p class="p">Alternatively, if an employee works only 6 hours a day and takes five days of paid sick
            leave, for a total of 30 hours, the employee will still have 10 hours remaining.</p>

         <p class="p">These examples assume the employee has earned or received up front their full amount of
            leave.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Q:</span> What if a local ordinance requires an employer to
            provide more paid sick leave than state law?</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> The employer must provide the paid sick leave required
            by the local ordinance if it is more than the requirements of state law.</p>

         <p class="p">In general, if employees are subject to local sick leave ordinances, the employer must
            comply with both the local and California laws, which may differ in some respects. The
            employer must provide the provision or benefit that is most generous to the
            employee.</p>

         <p class="p">The only exception to this general rule is that as of January 1, 2024, local ordinances
            cannot contradict the state paid sick leave law requirements regarding the lending of
            paid sick leave, paystub statements, calculation of paid sick leave, providing notice if
            the leave is foreseeable, timing of payment of paid sick leave, and whether payment of
            sick leave is required upon termination. If a local ordinance contradicts the state law
            on these specific topics, the state law prevails over (preempts) the local law.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Q:</span> What options do employers have to provide paid sick
            leave?</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> Employers may choose to have an <span class="q">“accrual”</span> policy
            or an <span class="q">“up front”</span> policy.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Q:</span> What is an accrual policy?</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> An accrual policy is one where employees earn sick
            leave over time, with the accrued time carrying over in each year of employment. In
            general terms (and subject to some exceptions), employees under an accrual plan must
            earn at least one hour of paid sick leave for each 30 hours of work (the 1:30 schedule).
            Although employers may adopt or keep other types of accrual schedules, the schedule must
            result in an employee having at least 24 hours of accrued sick leave or paid time off by
            the 120th calendar day of employment and 40 hours by the 200th calendar day of
            employment.</p>

         <p class="p">Although employees may accrue more than five days of paid sick leave under the one hour
            for every 30 hours worked accrual method (or under an alternative accrual standard), the
            law allows employers to limit an employee's use of paid sick leave to 40 hours or five
            days during a year. The law also allows an employer to limit an employee's total accrued
            paid sick leave to no more than 80 hours or ten days. Prior to January 1, 2024, an
            employer could limit an employee's use to 24 hours or three days during a year and an
            employee's accrual to no more than 48 hours or six days.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Q:</span> What is an up-€'front policy for providing paid sick
            leave?</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> An up-front policy makes the full amount of sick leave
            for the year available immediately at the beginning of a year-long period, except for
            initial hires where it must be available for use by the 120th day of employment. The
            employer must provide at least 40 hours or five days of paid sick leave per year and the
            full amount of this leave must be available for the employee's use from the beginning of
            each year of employment, calendar year, or 12-month period.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Q:</span> If an employer uses an accrual method and capped an
            employee's yearly use of leave at 3 days or 24 hours, what must an employer do to comply
            with the law on January 1, 2024?</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> If an employer uses an annual start date other than
            January 1 and implements a 12â€'month use cap, that cap must change to 40 hours or 5
            days on January 1, 2024. For example, if an employer uses the 12-month period of May 1 -
            April 30 and implements a cap, and an employee used 24 hours or three days before
            January 1, 2024, the employer must allow the employee to use an additional 2 days or 16
            hours before April 30 if the employee has accrued that additional leave.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Q:</span> If an employer utilized the <span class="q">“up-front”</span> method
            prior to January 1, 2024 and provided an employee with 3 days or 24 hours of leave on
            the employee's anniversary date during the year, what must an employer do to comply with
            the law on January 1, 2024?</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> The employer has the choice to frontload the two
            additional days on January 1, 2024 or move the measurement of the yearly period to
            January 1, 2024 and frontload five days. For example, if an employee started on May 1,
            2021, and the employer used that anniversary date to frontload 3 days or 24 hours on May
            1, 2023, the employer may either provide 2 days or 16 hours on January 1, 2024, and keep
            the May 1 date to frontload or can <span class="q">“reset”</span> the frontload date to January 1, 2024
            and provide the employee 5 days or 40 hours then.</p>
