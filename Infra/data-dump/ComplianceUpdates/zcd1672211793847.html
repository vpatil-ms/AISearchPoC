      <p class="p">The District of Columbia has enacted an ordinance expanding a program offering paid
         parental, family, and medical leave benefits to eligible employees. The changes are
         effective <span class="ph strong">October 1, 2021</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="zcd1672211793847__section_N1004D_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">In 2016, the District of Columbia enacted a paid family leave program funded by a tax paid by employers. Employees are eligible for benefits under the program as long as they spend at least 50 percent of their time physically working in the District of Columbia. Contributions to the program started in July 2019, and employees started receiving benefits July 2020. Under the existing program, eligible employees may receive:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Up to eight workweeks of paid parental leave benefits within a 52-workweek period for bonding associated with: <ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">The birth of a child; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The placement of a child for adoption or foster care; or </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The placement of a child for whom the employee legally assumes and discharges parental responsibility.</span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Up to six workweeks of paid family leave benefits within a 52-workweek period to provide care or companionship to a family member with a serious health condition, as defined by the Ordinance.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Up to two workweeks of paid medical leave benefits within a 52-workweek period for their own serious health condition. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Under the program, there is generally a one-week waiting period before employees may start receiving benefits.</p>
<p class="p">Employers must post a notice about the program in the workplace and inform their employees about the program at the time upon hiring, annually, and when paid family leave is needed.</p>
