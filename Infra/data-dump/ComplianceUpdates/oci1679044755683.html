         <p class="p">The Massachusetts Department of Family and Medical Leave (DFML) has
            announced the 2023 contribution rates for the state's Paid Family and Medical Leave
            program.</p>

         <p class="p">Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML) is a state program that offers up to
            26 weeks of paid leave for family or medical reasons to eligible employees (including
            former employees) in Massachusetts. PFML is funded through employee and employer
            contributions. You may find additional information on the PFML here: <a class="xref" href="https://www.mass.gov/guides/employers-introduction-to-paid-family-and-medical-leave" target="_blank">Employer's Introduction to Paid Family and Medical
               Leave | Mass.gov</a></p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">2023 - Employers with 25 or more covered
               individuals</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers with 25 or more covered individuals will be required to remit a
            contribution to the DFML of <span class="ph strong">0.63% of eligible wages</span>. This
            contribution can be split between covered individuals' payroll or wage withholdings and
            an employer contribution. (In 2022, the rate is 0.68%).</p>

         <p class="p">For Family Leave, up to 100% of the family leave contribution can be
            withheld from a covered individual's wages ( <span class="ph strong">0.11% of eligible
               wages</span>). (The rate is 0.12% in 2022).</p>

         <p class="p">For Medical Leave, up to 40% of the medical leave contribution can be
            withheld from a covered individual's wages ( <span class="ph strong">0.208% of eligible
               wages</span>). Employers are responsible for contributing the remaining 60% (<span class="ph strong">0.312% of eligible wages</span>). (These rates in 2022 are 0.224%
            and 0.336% respectively).</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">2023 - Employers with fewer than 25 covered
               individuals</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers with fewer than 25 covered individuals must remit an effective
            contribution rate of <span class="ph strong">0.318% of eligible wages</span>. This
            contribution rate is less because small employers are not required to pay the employer
            share of the medical leave contribution, reducing the total contribution amount. (The
            rate was 0.344% in 2022).</p>

         <p class="p">Small employers are responsible for remitting the funds withheld from
            covered individuals' earnings but are under no obligation to contribute themselves.
            However, they may elect to cover some or all of the covered individuals' share.</p>

         <p class="p">For Family Leave, up to 100% of the family leave contribution can be
            withheld from a covered individual's wages (<span class="ph strong"> 0.11% of eligible
               wages</span>). (The rate is 0.12% in 2022).</p>

         <p class="p">For Medical Leave, up to 100% of the medical leave contribution can be
            withheld from a covered individual's wages ( <span class="ph strong">0.208% of eligible
               wages</span>). There is no employer share for employers with fewer than 25 covered
            individuals. (The rate in 2022 is 0.224%).</p>
