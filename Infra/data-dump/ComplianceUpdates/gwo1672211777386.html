      <p class="p">California has enacted legislation (Assembly Bill 685) that requires
         employers to provide written notice to employees who may have been exposed to COVID-19 at
         their worksite. Assembly Bill 685 takes effect <span class="ph strong">January 1,
            2021</span>. The state also enacted Senate Bill 1159, which takes effect immediately and
         adds workers' compensation protections related to COVID-19.</p>

      <section class="section" id="gwo1672211777386__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Assembly Bill 685:</h2><p class="p">If an employer is put on notice of potential exposure to COVID-19, the employer must take all the following actions within one business day:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Notify employees of possible exposure.</span>
               Provide a written notice to all employees and their exclusive representative (if
               any), and the employers of subcontracted employees who were on the premises at the
               same worksite as the individual within the infectious period. The notice must be
               provided in a manner the employer normally uses to communicate employment-related
               information and may include, but is not limited to, personal service, email, or text
               message if it can reasonably be anticipated to be received by the employee within one
               business day of sending and must be in both English and the language understood by
               the majority of the employees. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Provide benefits-related information.</span>
               Provide information about COVID-19-related benefits to all employees who may have
               been exposed and to the exclusive representative, if any. This includes, but isn't
               limited to, workers' compensation, COVID-19-related leave, company sick leave,
               state-mandated leave, supplemental sick leave, or negotiated leave provisions, as
               well as anti-retaliation and anti-discrimination protections. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Communicate safety plan.</span> Notify all
               employees, and the employers of subcontracted employees and the exclusive
               representative, if any, on the disinfection and safety plan that the employer plans
               to implement and complete per the guidelines of the federal Centers for Disease
               Control. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Notify public health agency.</span> If an
               employer or representative of the employer is notified of the number of cases that
               meet the definition of a COVID-19 outbreak, as defined by the State Department of
               Public Health, within 48 hours, the employer must notify the local public health
               agency in the jurisdiction of the worksite of the: names, number, occupation, and
               worksite of the employees and the business address and NAICS code of the worksite
               where the individuals work. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Employers must maintain records of the required notifications for a period of at least three years.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Other Protections:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers are prohibited from requiring employees to disclose medical information unless otherwise required by law. Employers are also barred from retaliating against a worker for disclosing a positive COVID-19 test or diagnosis or order to quarantine or isolate.</p>
<p class="p">The law also gives Cal/OSHA additional enforcement powers if it determines that the worksite exposes workers to the risk of infection and constitutes an imminent hazard to employees.</p>

      <section class="section" id="gwo1672211777386__section_N10071_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Senate Bill 1159:</h2><p class="p">Effective immediately, Senate Bill 1159:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Codifies a recent executive order (N-62-20) to create a rebuttable presumption that illness or death related to COVID-19 is an occupational injury and therefore eligible for workers' compensation benefits (this presumption applies to employees who performed services at their place of employment at the employer's direction on or after March 19, 2020, and on or before July 5, 2020). </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Creates a rebuttable presumption that a peace officer, firefighter, specified frontline employees, and certain healthcare employees, who contract COVID-19 were infected with the virus via a workplace exposure. This presumption applies from July 6, 2020 and expires on January 1, 2023. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Establishes a presumption of compensability for employees who contract COVID-19 on or after July 6, 2020 from any employer with five or more employees that experiences an <span class="q">“outbreak”</span> of COVID-19 cases at a particular work location (this presumption expires on January 1, 2023). Notably, the definition of outbreak is different under Senate Bill 1159 than the one under Assembly Bill 685. See the text of the law for details. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Notification to Claims Administrator:</span></p>
<p class="p">When the employer knows or reasonably should know that an employee has tested positive for COVID-19, the employer must report to their claims administrator in writing within three business days all of the following:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">An employee has tested positive.</span> For
               purposes of this reporting, the employer is prohibited from providing any personally
               identifiable information regarding the employee who tested positive for COVID-19
               unless the employee asserts the infection is work related or has filed a claim form. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Date of positive result.</span> The date that
               the employee tests positive, which is the date the specimen was collected for
               testing. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Work address.</span> The specific address (or
               addresses) of the employee's specific place of employment during the 14-day period
               preceding the date of the employee's positive test. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Workforce count.</span> The highest number of
               employees who reported to work at the employee's specific place of employment in the
               45-day period preceding the last day the employee worked at each specific place of
               employment. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Any employer who is aware of an employee testing positive from July 6, 2020 to September 17, 2020 must also notify their claims administrator within 30 business days of September 17, 2020. See the text of the law for details on this reporting requirement.</p>
