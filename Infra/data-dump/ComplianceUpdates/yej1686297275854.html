      <p class="p">Colorado's Department of Labor and Employment has announced that a requirement for employers to provide public health emergency leave (PHEL) for COVID-19 will end June 8, 2023.</p>

      <section class="section" id="yej1686297275854__section_ent_pd1_txb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Colorado has a PHEL requirement that remains in effect until four weeks after any
            federal, state, or local declaration of a public health emergency has ended. The PHEL
            requirement has been in effect for COVID-19 since January 1, 2021. Since the state's
            declaration for COVID-19 ended on April 27, 2023, and the federal declaration for
            COVID-19 expired on May 11, 2023, the state's PHEL requirement for COVID-19 will end on
            June 8, 2023.</p>

         <p class="p">Employees with any PHEL remaining for COVID-19 may still take it through June 8, 2023.
            Employees are only eligible for up to 80 hours of PHEL once during the entirety of the
            public health emergency. If another public health emergency is declared in the future, a
            new PHEL requirement will be triggered for that declaration.</p>

         <p class="p">Keep in mind that a state requirement for employers to provide paid sick leave remains
            in effect. Under the law, paid sick leave must accrue at a rate of at least one hour for
            every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 48 hours. However, employers have the option
            of providing all the paid sick leave at the beginning of the year. Employees are
            entitled to carry over up to 48 hours of unused paid sick leave to the following
            year.</p>
