      <p class="p">Illinois has enacted legislation (House Bill 3129), which requires employers with 15 or more employees to include in job postings the pay scale and benefits for the position. House Bill 3129 takes effect January 1, 2025.</p>

      <section class="section" id="inr1695880695061__section_m54_p1b_yyb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The requirement for job postings only applies to positions that:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="inr1695880695061__ul_q2x_p1b_yyb">
            <li><span class="li">Will be physically performed, at least in part, in Illinois; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Will be physically performed outside of Illinois, but the employee reports to a
               supervisor, office, or other worksite in Illinois. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The law defines <span class="q">“pay scale and benefits”</span> as the wage or salary, or the wage or
            salary range, and a general description of the benefits and other compensation,
            including, but not limited to, bonuses, stock options, or other incentives the employer
            reasonably expects in good faith to offer for the position.</p>

         <p class="p">The range may be set by reference to any applicable pay scale, the previously determined
            range for the position, the actual range of others currently holding equivalent
            positions, or the budgeted amount for the position, as applicable.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers may satisfy the requirement by including a hyperlink to a publicly viewable
            webpage that includes the pay scale and benefits.</p>

         <p class="p">If an employer engages a third party to announce, post, publish, or otherwise make known
            a job posting, the employer must provide the pay scale and benefits, or a hyperlink to
            the pay scale and benefits, to the third party. The third party must include the pay
            scale and benefits, or a hyperlink to the pay scale and benefits, in the job
            posting.</p>

         <p class="p">If no job posting will be made by the employer or a third party, employers must disclose
            the pay scale and benefits for the position prior to any offer or discussion of
            compensation and at the applicant's request.</p>
