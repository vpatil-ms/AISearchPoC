      <p class="p">California has enacted legislation (Assembly Bill 2188) that prohibits
         employers from discriminating against individuals because of their use of cannabis while
         off duty. Assembly Bill 2188 takes effect on <span class="ph strong">January 1,
         2024</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ixn1679044755952__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         <p class="p">Effective January 1, 2024, California employers are prohibited from discriminating
            against individuals based on:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="ixn1679044755952__ul_qtx_tgl_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Their use of cannabis while off the job and away from the workplace. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employer-required drug test that has found non-psychoactive cannabis metabolites
               in hair, blood, urine or other bodily fluids. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Employers will still be able to prohibit employees from using, possessing or being
            impaired by cannabis at work. The law also doesn't prohibit an employer from taking
            adverse action against an individual based on a scientifically valid preemployment drug
            screening conducted through methods that don't screen for nonpsychoactive cannabis
            metabolites.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Drug Testing:</span></p>
<p class="p">By way of background, Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the chemical compound in cannabis that can cause impairment and psychoactive effects. After THC is metabolized, it's stored in the body as a nonpsychoactive cannabis metabolite. While these metabolites can show cannabis consumption in prior weeks, they don't indicate impairment.</p>
<p class="p">As a result of Assembly Bill 2188, the drug tests that only show the presence of nonpsychoactive cannabis metabolites (and not impairment) will generally be off limits to employers beginning in 2024. Instead, employers must rely on valid alternative tests, including impairment tests, which measure an individual employee against their own baseline performance, and tests that identify the presence of THC in an individual's bodily fluids.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Exemptions:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The law doesn't apply to:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="ixn1679044755952__ul_f4r_rgl_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">An employee in the building and construction trades. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Applicants or employees hired for positions that require a federal government
               background investigation or security clearance in accordance with regulations issued
               by the United States Department of Defense, or equivalent regulations applicable to
               other agencies. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The law also doesn't preempt state or federal laws requiring applicants or employees to
            be tested for controlled substances (and the manner in which they are tested). This
            includes laws and regulations for receiving federal funding or federal licensing-related
            benefits, or entering into a federal contract.</p>

            <li><span class="li">Consult legal counsel to determine the impact of Assembly Bill 2188 on current drug testing policies and practices, including whether an exemption applies. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Unless an exemption applies, ensure drug testing policies and practices comply with Assembly Bill 2188 by January 1, 2024. </span></li>
