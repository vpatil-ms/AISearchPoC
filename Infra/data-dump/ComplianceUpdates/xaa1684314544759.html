      <p class="p">The Illinois Department of Labor (IDOL) has published amended regulations implementing a law that requires employers to reimburse employees for certain business expenditures.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xaa1684314544759__section_qql_l2y_mxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">By way of background, Illinois employers must reimburse employees for all necessary
            expenditures or losses incurred within their scope of employment and directly related to
            services performed for the employer. The law considers necessary expenditures as
            expenses or losses required in the discharge of an employee's duties and those that are
            for the primary benefit of the employer.</p>

         <p class="p">The amended regulations clarify definitions and requirements under the reimbursement
            law.</p>

      </section>

      <section class="section" id="xaa1684314544759__section_N10051_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Primary benefit of employer</h2><p class="p">Under the amended regulations, when determining if an expense is to the primary benefit of the employer, the relevant factors to be considered are:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Whether the employee has any expectation of reimbursement; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Whether the expense is required or necessary to perform the employee's job duties; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Whether the employer is receiving a value that it would otherwise need to pay for; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">How long the employer is receiving the benefit; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Whether the expense is required of the job. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Under this test, no single factor is dispositive. Instead, the analysis should focus on the extent to which the expense benefits the employer and its business and business model.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xaa1684314544759__section_N10075_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Denied requests</h2><p class="p">If an employer denies or fails to respond to a request for reimbursement that should have been reimbursable under the law, the employee may file a claim against the employer with the IDOL.</p>
<p class="p">If an employee cannot recover expenses during the course of the employee's employment, these expenses must be included in the final compensation owed to an employee at the end of the employee's employment.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xaa1684314544759__section_N10082_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Recordkeeping</h2><p class="p">Employers must retain the following records for at least three years:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">All policies regarding reimbursement; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">All employee requests for reimbursement; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Documentation showing approval or denial of reimbursement; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Documentation showing actual reimbursement and supporting documents. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="xaa1684314544759__section_ykk_n2y_mxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Next Steps</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Illinois employers should review policies and practices to ensure compliance with the
            expense reimbursement law and <a class="xref" href="https://www.ilga.gov/commission/jcar/admincode/056/056003000B05400R.html" target="_blank">regulations</a>.</p>
