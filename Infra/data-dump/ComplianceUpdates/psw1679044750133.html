      <p class="p">Tennessee has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 958) that allows employers to create a voluntary shared work program. Senate Bill 958 took effect on May 27, 2022.</p>

      <section class="section" id="psw1679044750133__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         <p class="p">Tennessee has established a shared work program that allows employers to reduce and
            evenly redistribute work hours among a group of employees to avoid layoffs.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Shared Work Plan Requirements:</span></p>
<p class="p">To participate in the shared work program, an employer must submit a written plan to the state administrator. To be approved, the plan must:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Provide an estimate of how many layoffs would occur without the program; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Certify that the total reduction in work hours would have impacted at least 10% of the employees in the affected group; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Apply to at least 10% of the employees in the affected group; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Ensure that the affected group of employees was not reduced by temporary layoffs of over 10% of the workers in the past four months; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Reduce the usual weekly hours for affected employees by at least 10% and up to 40%; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Continue health, retirement, and fringe benefits for the affected employees as though their work was not reduced; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Not act as a subsidy for part-time, intermittent, or seasonal employees. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employee Eligibility and Benefits:</span></p>

         <p class="p">An employee is eligible for shared work benefits if they are a member of an affected
            group and able and available to work during the normal work week.</p>

         <p class="p">Eligible employees are entitled to replace a portion of their lost wages by collecting a
            portion of their unemployment benefits (their regular weekly unemployment benefit
            multiplied by the percentage of the reduction in their usual weekly working hours) for
            up to 25 weeks.</p>

            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Under the law, <a class="xref" href="https://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/112/Bill/SB0958.pdf" target="_blank">additional rules</a> exist if an employee works for a shared work employer and
               another employer.</p>

         <p class="p">Tennessee employers should consult legal counsel to discuss the impact
            of Senate Bill 958 on their staffing policies and practices.</p>
