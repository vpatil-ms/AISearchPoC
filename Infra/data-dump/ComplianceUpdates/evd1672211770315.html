On February 2021, the state provided situational guidance for employees subject to multiple quarantine or isolation orders, for when an employee tests positive following their quarantine, and for when an employer mandates that an employee stay home due to potential exposure.</p>

<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Situation 1:</span></p>
<p class="p">An employee who returns to work following a period of mandatory quarantine or isolation does not need to be tested before returning to work, except for nursing home staff. However, an employee who subsequently receives a positive COVID-19 test result must not report to work. In such cases, the employee will be subject to a mandatory isolation order from the New York Department of Health (DOH) and is entitled to quarantine leave, whether or not the employee already has received such leave for the first period of quarantine or isolation. The employee must submit documentation from a licensed medical provider or testing facility attesting that they tested positive for COVID-19, unless the positive result came from an employer-provided test.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Situation 2:</span></p>
<p class="p">An employee who is subject to a quarantine or isolation order, but continues to test positive for COVID-19 at the end of their quarantine or isolation period must not report to work (though it's not recommended that an employee be tested in order to end isolation or quarantine). In such cases, the employee will be subject to a second mandatory isolation order from the DOH and is entitled to quarantine leave for the second period of isolation. The employee must submit documentation from a licensed medical provider or testing facility attesting that they tested positive for COVID-19 after completing the initial period of isolation, unless the positive result came from an employer-provided test.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Situation 3:</span></p>
<p class="p">If an employer mandates that an employee who is not otherwise subject to a quarantine or isolation order to remain out of work due to potential exposure to COVID-19, the employer must continue to pay the employee at their regular rate of pay until the employer permits the employee to return to work or the employee becomes subject to a mandatory quarantine or isolation order. At that time, the employee must receive quarantine leave for the period of time the employee is subject to such an order.</p>

         <p class="p">In no case does an employee qualify for quarantine leave for more than
            three orders of quarantine or isolation, and the second and third orders of quarantine
            or isolation must be based on a positive COVID-19 test. For more information, visit New
