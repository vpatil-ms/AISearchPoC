      <p class="p">Oregon has enacted a final rule that requires employers to provide protections to workers that are exposed to high heat. The final rule is effective immediately.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kpq1679044751628__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) had adopted an emergency rule in July 2021 that added protections for workers against heat hazards.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kpq1679044751628__section_N1004A_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2><p class="p">The final rule creates a permanent safety standard that requires Oregon employers to take steps to prevent heat illness when temperatures meet or exceed certain temperatures. The standard also defines safety terms and provides limited exceptions to the requirements. See the <a class="xref" href="https://osha.oregon.gov/OSHARules/adopted/2022/ao3-2022-text-alh-heat.pdf" target="_blank">text of the law</a> for definitions and exceptions.</p>

            when the temperature in the work area meets or exceeds 80 degrees Fahrenheit (<span class="ph strong">high heat</span>) and when the temperature exceeds 90 degrees
            Fahrenheit (<span class="ph strong">extreme heat</span>).</p>
<p class="p">The standard does not apply to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Employee transportation, when employees are in a vehicle and are not performing work; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Work activities with less than 15 minutes of exposure in a 60-minute period; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Buildings and structures that have a mechanical ventilation system that keeps the heat index below 80 degrees Fahrenheit; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Emergency services; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Other less common exceptions. See the <a class="xref" href="https://osha.oregon.gov/OSHARules/adopted/2022/ao3-2022-text-alh-heat.pdf" target="_blank">text of the law</a> for further details. </span></li>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Training Requirements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must provide annual training on heat illness prevention before
            employees begin work that would reasonably be anticipated to expose them to the risk of
            heat illness.</p>

         <p class="p">The training must be provided to all employees, including new employees,
            supervisory and non-supervisory employees, and be in a language and vocabulary that is
            readily understood and in a manner that facilitates employee feedback.</p>

         <p class="p">The training must cover the following factors:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Heat acclimatization and what affects the tolerance of heat stress; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Common signs and symptoms of the types of heat-related illness; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employee and employer rights and obligations; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Environmental and personal risk factors relating to heat illness; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The reasons to quickly report signs or symptoms of illness. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Under the standard, when the temperature of a work area reaches the high
            heat threshold, an employer must provide the following to employees:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Access to an adequate supply of free cool or cold drinking water
               (enough for each employee to have 32 ounces of water per hour); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Ample opportunity to drink water; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A shaded area that meets certain specifications or, if that is not
               safe or not feasible, provide other cooling measures. </span></li>

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Develop and implement effective acclimatization practices that, through gradual exposure, allow for the temporary adaptation of the body to work in heat; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Assign responsibility to at least one employee per worksite to make emergency medical service calls; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Maintain effective worksite communication between supervisors and employees; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Ensure that employees are observed and monitored for signs and symptoms of heat illness through: <ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">The creation of a mandatory buddy system; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Ensuring regular communications to employees that work alone; or </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Another equally effective system of observation or communication; </span></li>

               </ul>

            <li><span class="li">Have all employees take required rest breaks in a shaded or temperature-controlled area; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Implement a rest break schedule model as required by law, either: <ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health plan; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">An employer-made schedule that is based on the effect of clothing and PPE, work intensity, and the location and relative humidity at the work location; or </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Oregon OSHA's simplified schedule. This requires longer and more frequent breaks as temperatures at the worksite increase, and requires breaks lasting at least 10 minutes every two hours. </span></li>
