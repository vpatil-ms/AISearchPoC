      <p class="p">Tennessee has enacted legislation (House Bill 1853), which amends its Lawful Employment Act (the Act) to require employers to take certain actions regarding a candidate's work authorization status. House Bill 1853 takes effect on January 1, 2023.</p>

      <section class="section" id="sth1679044749407__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">Under federal law, employers are required to verify that each new hire is authorized to work in the United States by completing a Form I-9. Employers are prohibited from knowingly hiring or continuing to employ individuals who are not authorized to work.</p>
<p class="p">The federal government developed an online electronic verification system known as <span class="q">“E-Verify,”</span> which is a free Internet-based system operated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in partnership with the Social Security Administration. E-Verify allows employers to verify the employment eligibility of newly hired employees by comparing the information provided on the employee's Form I-9 to DHS databases. Currently, there is no federal requirement for private employers to use E-Verify, but some states have E-Verify mandates.</p>

      <section class="section" id="sth1679044749407__section_N10051_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Tennessee E-Verify Requirements:</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Covered Employers:</span></p>
<p class="p">The Act lowers the threshold of employees that is used to determine whether an
            employer must use the federal E-Verify system from 50 to <span class="ph strong">35</span> full time equivalent employees beginning <span class="ph strong">January 1,
               2023</span>.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Verification Assistance Provisions:</span></p>
<p class="p">The law allows the state's office of employment verification assistance to help employers who do not have internet access, or those with fewer than 35 full time equivalent employees, to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Enroll, at no charge, in the federal E-Verify program or conduct work authorization status checks; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Conduct work authorization status checks of the employer's employees by using the E-Verify program, so long as the employer signs a prescribed form that attests to their qualification for assistance and completes paperwork required by the E-Verify program to permit the office to provide the assistance. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The law also clarifies that an employer is not liable for violating the Act during times in which the E-Verify program is suspended or not operational or if the employer receives and acts on a false employee report from the federal E-Verify program.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Illegal Alien Provisions:</span></p>
<p class="p">The Act, which already prohibits an employer from knowingly employing, recruiting or referring (for a fee) an illegal alien, is amended to also prohibit knowingly rehiring an illegal alien.</p>
<p class="p">Recordkeeping:</p>
<p class="p">The law requires employers to maintain an E-Verify case result for each employee that shows that the employee is authorized to work through either the:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">E-Verify Quick Audit Report; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">E-Verify User Audit Report; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Individual employee E-Verify case verification result. </span></li>

         </ul>

<p class="p">However, under the law, an employee cannot sue for retaliatory discharge or national origin discrimination if the employer terminates the employee because the employer discovers through the federal E-Verify program that the employee is not authorized to work in the United States and the employer was unaware of the employee's work status.</p>
