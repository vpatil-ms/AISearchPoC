      <p class="p">The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has released an emergency temporary standard (ETS) that implements several new requirements for employers with 100 or more employees to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including vaccination and testing mandates.</p>

      <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">UPDATE:</span> On December 17, 2021, The U.S. Court of Appeals for
         the Sixth Circuit issued a ruling that allows OSHA to resume efforts to implement the
         emergency temporary standard (ETS). Shortly after the Sixth Circuit dissolved the stay,
         OSHA announced that it wouldn't take action against businesses for noncompliance with any
         portion of the ETS before January 10, 2022, and specifically with respect to the ETS's
         testing requirements, before February 9, 2022, <span class="q">“so long as an employer is exercising
            reasonable, good faith efforts to come into compliance with the standard.”</span> Trade
         groups have filed an Emergency Application for review before the United States Supreme
         Court. The Application requests an immediate stay of the ETS pending review by the Supreme
         Court. Employers should watch for developments closely.</p>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N10054_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">On September 9, President Biden signed an Executive Order implementing several new policies to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The Order noted that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) would issue guidance requiring employers with 100 or more employees to require their employees to either be vaccinated against COVID-19 or produce a weekly negative test. On November 4, 2021, OSHA released an ETS to implement the requirements announced in the Executive Order.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N1005E_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Covered Employers:</h2><p class="p">This ETS applies to all employers with a total of 100 or more employees at any time the ETS is in effect, unless the employer falls under one of the exemptions outlined below. Based on this scope, employers in nearly every sector are expected to be covered by this ETS.</p>
<p class="p">The applicability of this ETS is based on the size of an employer, in terms of number of employees, rather than on the type or number of workplaces. In determining the number of employees, employers must include all employees across all of their U.S. locations, regardless of employees' vaccination status or where they perform their work. Part-time employees do count towards the company total, but independent contractors don't.</p>
<p class="p">Examples provided by the ETS in determining the 100-employee threshold:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">If an employer has 75 part-time employees and 25 full-time employees, the employer would be within the scope of this ETS because it has 100 employees. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If an employer has 102 employees and only 3 ever report to an office location, that employer would be covered. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If an employer has 200 employees, all of whom are vaccinated, that employer would be covered. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If an employer has 125 employees, and 115 of them work exclusively outdoors, that employer would be covered. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If a single corporation has 50 small locations (e.g., kiosks, concession stands) with at least 100 total employees in its combined locations, that employer would be covered even if some of the locations have no more than one or two employees assigned to work there. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If a host employer has 80 permanent employees and 30 temporary employees supplied by a staffing agency, the host employer wouldn't count the staffing agency employees for coverage purposes and therefore wouldn't be covered. (So long as the staffing agency has at least 100 employees, however, the staffing agency would be responsible for ensuring compliance with the ETS for the jointly employed workers.) </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">OSHA says it is confident that employers with 100 or more employees have the administrative capacity to implement the standard's requirements promptly, but is less confident that smaller employers can do so without undue disruption. OSHA announced that it will assess the capacity of smaller employers to follow similar requirements and is seeking comment to help the agency make that determination. In addition, OSHA's new finding of grave danger applies to healthcare and healthcare support workers who aren't covered by the Healthcare ETS, to the extent they remain unvaccinated.</p>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N1008C_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Deadlines:</h2><p class="p">The compliance date for all provisions in the ETS is December 5, 2021, except for COVID-19 testing for employees who aren't fully vaccinated, which requires compliance by January 4, 2022. Note that the vaccination deadline of January 4, 2022, is only to receive the full dose shots (2nd shot of Pfizer/ Moderna or 1st shot of Johnson &amp; Johnson). The employee doesn't have to receive the full dose shots two weeks prior to that deadline and isn't required to receive any booster shots.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N10096_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employees Exempted from the ETS:</h2><p class="p">OSHA's ETS provides for several categories of workers who are exempted from the ETS's requirements:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Workers who don't report to a workplace where other individuals are present or who telework from home; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Workers who perform their work exclusively outdoors – if they work outdoors on all days, except for de minimis use of indoor spaces, such as restrooms, and don't occupy vehicles with other workers for work purposes; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Workplaces covered under the Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors, as these workers are already covered by a vaccination mandate; and, </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Settings where any employee provides healthcare services or healthcare support services when subject to the requirements of the Healthcare ETS, since these workers are also covered by a vaccination mandate. </span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N100B3_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employer Policy on Vaccination:</h2><p class="p">The ETS requires each covered employer to establish and implement a written mandatory vaccination policy unless the employer adopts an alternative policy requiring COVID-19 testing once every seven days and face coverings for unvaccinated employees.</p>
<p class="p">To meet the definition of <span class="q">“mandatory vaccination policy,”</span> the policy must require vaccination of all employees, including all new employees as soon as practicable, other than those employees:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">For whom a vaccine is medically contraindicated, </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">For whom medical necessity requires a delay in vaccination, or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Those legally entitled to a reasonable accommodation under federal civil rights laws because they have a disability or sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance that conflict with the vaccination requirement. </span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N100D3_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">COVID-19 Testing for Unvaccinated Employees:</h2><p class="p">The ETS requires employers to ensure that employees who aren't fully vaccinated and who report at least once every seven days to a workplace where other individuals such as coworkers or customers are present are:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Tested for COVID-19 at least once every seven days; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide documentation of the most recent COVID-19 test result to the employer no later than the seventh day following the date the employee last provided a test result. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Employers must also ensure that employees who aren't fully vaccinated and don't report during a period of seven or more days to a workplace where other individuals are present are:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Tested for COVID-19 within seven days prior to returning to the workplace; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide documentation of that test result upon return to the workplace. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">If an employee doesn't provide documentation of a COVID-19 test result as required by the ETS, the employer must keep that employee removed from the workplace until they provide a test result.</p>
<p class="p">In addition, when an employee has received a positive COVID-19 test, or has been diagnosed with COVID-19 by a licensed healthcare provider, the employer must remove the employee from the workplace immediately and until they meet criteria for return and may not require that employee to undergo COVID-19 testing for 90 days following the date of their positive test or diagnosis.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N100FC_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Face Coverings:</h2><p class="p">The ETS requires the employer to ensure that all employees who aren't fully vaccinated wear a face covering when indoors and when occupying a vehicle with another person for work purposes, except:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">When an employee is alone in a room with floor to ceiling walls and a closed door; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">For a limited time while the employee is eating or drinking at the workplace or for identification purposes in compliance with safety and security requirements; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When employees are wearing respirators or face masks; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Where the employer can show that the use of face coverings is infeasible or creates a greater hazard. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Face covering means a covering that completely covers the nose and mouth of the wearer, excluding face shields, which is made with two or more layers of a breathable fabric that is tightly woven, is secured to the wearer's head with ties, ear loops, or elastic bands that go behind the head, and is a solid piece of material without slits, exhalation valves, visible holes, or other openings in the material. Also acceptable are face coverings that include clear plastic windows, such as those utilized by persons communicating with those who are deaf or hard-of-hearing or when seeing a person's mouth is otherwise important.</p>
<p class="p">The employer must permit the employee to wear a respirator instead of a face covering, whether required or not. In addition, the employer may provide respirators or face coverings to the employee, even if not required. In such circumstances, where the employer provides respirators, the employer must also comply with § 1910.504, Mini respiratory protection program.</p>
<p class="p">Employers cannot prohibit any employee – even those who are vaccinated – from wearing a mask.</p>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N10122_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employer Required Information to Employee:</h2><p class="p">The ETS requires the employer to inform each employee, in a language and at a literacy level the employee understands about:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The requirements of the ETS, as well as any employer policies and procedures established to implement the ETS; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">COVID-19 vaccine efficacy, safety, and the benefits of being vaccinated, by providing employees the CDC document, <span class="q">“Key Things to Know About COVID-19 Vaccines,”</span> available at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- ncov/vaccines/keythingstoknow.html (CDC, October 7, 2021), to each employee. The employer may choose to provide this information to employees in either an electronic or print format. The CDC currently provides this document in multiple languages; however, employers may need to provide additional translations if necessary; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The time and pay/leave they are entitled to for vaccinations and any side effects experienced following vaccinations; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The requirements of the OSH Act that work together to protect employees from retaliation for engaging in activities protected by OSHA statute or regulation. The first of these provisions prohibits employers from discharging or in any manner discriminating against any employee for reporting a work-related injury or illness. The second provision prohibits employers from discriminating or retaliating against employees for exercising rights under, or as a result of actions required by, the ETS, including filing complaints or reporting work-related injuries; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The procedures they need to follow to provide notice of a positive COVID-19 test or diagnosis of COVID-19 by a licensed healthcare provider, as well as the procedures to be used for requesting records (more details below); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Information regarding the prohibitions of the OSH Act, which provide for criminal penalties associated with knowingly supplying false statements or documentation. False statements or documents made or submitted for purposes of complying with policies required by this ETS could fall under either or both of these statutory provisions; and, </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Additional information to unvaccinated employees, including information about the employer's policies and procedures for COVID-19 testing and face coverings. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">When an employer's policies or procedures change, the employer must provide any updated or supplemental information to employees.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N10152_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employee Notification to Employer of a Positive COVID-19 Test:</h2><p class="p">The employer must require each employee to promptly notify the employer if they receive a positive COVID-19 test or are diagnosed with COVID-19 by a licensed healthcare provider and must immediately remove any employee from the workplace who receives a positive COVID-19 test or is diagnosed with COVID-19 by a licensed healthcare provider.</p>
<p class="p">The employee must be removed until the employee: (i) receives a negative result on a COVID-19 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) following a positive result on a COVID-19 antigen test if the employee chooses to seek a NAAT test for confirmatory testing; (ii) meets the return to work criteria in CDC's <span class="q">“Isolation Guidance”</span>; or (iii) receives a recommendation to return to work from a licensed healthcare provider.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N10163_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Determining Employee's Vaccination Status:</h2><p class="p">The ETS requires employers to determine the vaccination status of each employee. Employers must require employees to provide an acceptable proof of vaccination status, including whether they are fully or partially vaccinated.</p>
<p class="p">Acceptable proof of vaccination status is:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The record of immunization from a health care provider or pharmacy; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A copy of the COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A copy of medical records documenting the vaccination; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A copy of immunization records from a public health, state, or tribal immunization information system; or a copy of any other official documentation that contains the type of vaccine administered, date(s) of administration, and the name of the health care professional(s) or clinic site(s) administering the vaccine(s). </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">A signed and dated employee attestation is acceptable in instances when an employee is unable to produce proof of vaccination. Specifically, in instances where an employee is unable to produce acceptable proof of vaccination, per above, it is acceptable for the employee to provide a signed and dated statement by the employee, subject to criminal penalties for knowingly providing false information: (1) attesting to their vaccination status (fully vaccinated or partially vaccinated); and (2) testing that they have lost and are otherwise unable to produce proof required by the ETS.</p>
<p class="p">Finally, when an employer has ascertained employee vaccination status prior to the effective date of the ETS through another form of attestation or proof, and retained records of that ascertainment, the employer is exempt from the requirements of collecting proof of vaccination status. The exemption applies only for each employee whose fully vaccinated status has been documented prior to the effective date of the standard. For example, an employer may have asked each employee to self-report their vaccination status without requiring the employee to provide any form of proof. If that self-reporting was through oral conversation only, and not documented in some way, the employer isn't considered to have retained records of that ascertainment for the purposes of this ETS. However, if, for example, the employer had the employees provide their vaccine information on a dated form, or through individual emails retained by the employer, or on an employer portal specifically created for employees to provide documentation status, or the employer created and retained some other means of documentation, the employer is considered to have retained records of ascertainment for the purposes of this ETS. Even if this exemption applies, the employer must still develop a roster of each employee's vaccination status and include on that roster the employees for whom it had previously determined and retained records of vaccination status.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N10189_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Recordkeeping Requirements:</h2><p class="p">The employer must maintain a record and a roster of each employee's vaccination status. Employers must also maintain a record of each test result provided by each employee. This information is subject to applicable legal requirements for confidentiality of medical information. These records must be preserved while the ETS is in effect.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N10193_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employee Access to Records:</h2><p class="p">The employer must make available, for examination and copying, the individual COVID-19 vaccine documentation and any COVID-19 test results required by the ETS for a particular employee to that employee and to anyone having written authorized consent of that employee by the end of the next business day after a request.</p>
<p class="p">The ETS also requires the employer to make the following information available to an employee or an employee representative on request: (1) the aggregate number of fully vaccinated employees at a workplace and (2) the total number of employees at that workplace. This information must be made available to these individuals by the end of the next business day after a request. Employers will be able to utilize the roster of each employee's vaccination status they are required to maintain to provide this information promptly to a requester.</p>
<p class="p">Employee, for purposes of this requirement, includes former employees.</p>
<p class="p">Requesters are entitled to one free copy of each requested record. After receiving an initial, free copy of a requested record or document, an employee, former employee, or representative may be charged a reasonable fee for copying duplicative records. However, no fee may be charged for an update to a previously requested record. It should be noted that each COVID-19 test is a separate record, and, as such, the employee or the representative is entitled to one free copy of each COVID-19 test record.</p>
<p class="p">OSHA notes that since the aggregate totals of fully vaccinated employees and total employees made available by request don't contain any personal identifiable information or personal medical information, OSHA says it doesn't believe that access to these records raises any serious confidentiality or privacy concern if disclosed to employees or their representatives.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N101A9_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">OSHA Access to Records:</h2><p class="p">Employers must provide the written vaccine policy required by the ETS and both the aggregate number of fully vaccinated employees at a workplace and the total number of employees at that workplace, to the Assistant Secretary of OSHA for examination and copying within four business hours of a request.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N101B3_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employer Support for Employee Vaccination:</h2><p class="p">The ETS requires all covered employers to support vaccination by providing employees with reasonable time, including up to four hours of paid time, to receive each vaccination dose, and reasonable time and paid leave to recover from vaccination side effects.</p>
<p class="p">OSHA understands that employees may need much less than four hours to receive a primary vaccination dose, for example, if vaccinations are offered on-site. However, OSHA also understands that, in some circumstances, an employee may need more than four hours to receive a primary vaccination dose, in which case the additional time, as long as it is reasonable, would be considered unpaid but protected leave. The employer cannot terminate the employee if they use a reasonable amount of time to receive their primary vaccination doses. The employee may use other available leave time (e.g., sick leave or vacation time) to cover the additional time needed to receive a vaccination dose that would otherwise be unpaid.</p>
<p class="p">If an employee already has accrued paid sick leave, an employer may require the employee to use that paid sick leave when recovering from side effects experienced following a primary vaccination dose. Additionally, if an employer doesn't specify between different types of leave (i.e., employees are granted only one type of leave), the employer may require employees to use that leave when recovering from vaccination side effects. If an employer provides employees with multiple types of leave, such as sick leave and vacation leave, the employer can only require employees to use the sick leave when recovering from vaccination side effects. Employers cannot require employees to use advanced sick leave to cover reasonable time needed to recover from vaccination side effects. An employer may not require an employee to accrue negative paid sick leave or borrow against future paid sick leave to recover from vaccination side effects.</p>
<p class="p">Employers aren't, however, obligated by this ETS to reimburse employees for transportation costs (e.g., gas money, train/bus fare, etc.) incurred to receive the vaccination. This could include the costs of travel to an off-site vaccination location (e.g., a pharmacy) or travel from an alternate work location (e.g., telework) to the workplace to receive a vaccination dose. Because employers are required to provide reasonable time for vaccination during work hours, if an employee chooses to receive a primary vaccination dose outside of work hours, employers aren't required to grant paid time to the employee for the time spent receiving the vaccine during non-work hours. However, even if employees receive a primary vaccination dose outside of work hours, employers must still afford them reasonable time and paid sick leave to recover from side effects that they experience during scheduled work time.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N101C6_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Costs Associated with Testing and Face Coverings:</h2><p class="p">Where an employee chooses to remain unvaccinated, the ETS doesn't require employers to pay for the costs associated with regular COVID-19 testing or the use of face coverings. That is, employees will be required to bear the costs if they choose to be regularly tested and wear a face covering in lieu of vaccination, though other laws, regulations or orders or agreements, such as collective bargaining agreements, could require otherwise. For example, OSHA notes, that in certain circumstances, the employer may be required, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, to pay for the time it takes an employee to be tested (e.g., if employee testing is conducted in the middle of a work shift). In addition, some states have expense reimbursement statutes and some state laws ban employers from passing on to employees the costs of mandatory medical examinations.</p>
<p class="p">The ETS doesn't require the employer to provide paid time off to any employee for removal from work as a result of the employee's refusal/failure to provide documentation of a COVID-19 test result as required by the ETS.</p>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N101D3_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The ETS Preempts State and Local Laws:</h2><p class="p">OSHA intends the ETS to address comprehensively the occupational and safety and health issues of vaccination, wearing face coverings, and testing for COVID-19. Thus, the standard is intended to preempt states, and political subdivisions of states, from adopting and enforcing workplace requirements relating to these issues, except under the authority of a Federally-approved State Plan. In particular, OSHA intends to preempt any state or local requirements that ban or limit an employer from requiring vaccination, face coverings, or testing.</p>

      <section class="section" id="bub1672211795416__section_N101DD_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">State Plans:</h2><p class="p">When federal OSHA promulgates an emergency temporary standard, States and U.S. Territories with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans (<span class="q">“State Plans”</span>) must either amend their standards to be identical or <span class="q">“at least as effective as”</span> the new standard, or show that an existing State Plan standard covering this area is "at least as effective" as the new Federal standard.</p>
<p class="p">The ETS imposes new requirements to protect workers across the nation from COVID-19. Adoption of this ETS, or an ETS that is at least as effective as this ETS, by State Plans must be completed within 30 days of the promulgation date of the final Federal rule, and State Plans must notify Federal OSHA of the action they will take within 15 days.</p>
<p class="p">The State Plan standard must remain in effect for the duration of the Federal ETS. As with all non-identical State Plan standards, OSHA will review any comparable State standards to determine whether they are at least as effective as this ETS.</p>
