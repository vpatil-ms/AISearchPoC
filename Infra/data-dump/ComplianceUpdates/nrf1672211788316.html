      <p class="p">The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has announced an <a class="xref" href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/ets" target="_blank">emergency temporary standard</a> (ETS) aimed at protecting healthcare workers from COVID-19. Among other things, the ETS requires covered employers to develop a COVID-19 plan and provide workers with paid time off to get vaccinated and to recover from any side effects. OSHA announced the ETS alongside new general industry guidance.</p>

      <section class="section" id="nrf1672211788316__section_N1004F_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">ETS:</h2><p class="p">The ETS is aimed at protecting workers facing the highest COVID-19 hazards—those
            working in healthcare settings where suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients are
            treated. This includes employees in hospitals, nursing homes, and assisted living
            facilities; emergency responders; home healthcare workers; and employees in ambulatory
            care facilities where suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients are treated. OSHA has
            created <a class="xref" href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA4125.pdf" target="_blank">this chart</a> to help employers determine whether
            they are covered by the ETS.</p>
<p class="p">The ETS is effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register. Employers must comply with most of the ETS provisions within 14 days and with the provisions involving physical barriers, ventilation, and training (see below) within 30 days of that publication. OSHA says it may use its discretion to refrain from citing employers who miss a compliance deadline if they are making a good-faith effort to comply.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Key Requirements:</span></p>
<p class="p">The key requirements of the ETS are:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">COVID-19 plan:</span> Develop and implement a
               COVID-19 plan (in writing if more than 10 employees) that includes a designated
               safety coordinator with authority to ensure compliance, a workplace-specific hazard
               assessment, involvement of non-managerial employees in hazard assessment and plan
               development/implementation, and policies and procedures to minimize the risk of
               transmission of COVID-19 to employees. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Patient screening and management:</span>
               Limit and monitor points of entry to settings where direct patient care is provided;
               screen and triage patients, clients, and other visitors and non-employees; implement
               patient management strategies. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Standard and Transmission-Based
                  Precautions:</span> Develop and implement policies and procedures to adhere to
               Standard and Transmission-Based precautions based on CDC guidelines. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Personal protective equipment (PPE):</span>
               Provide and ensure each employee wears a facemask when indoors and when occupying a
               vehicle with other people for work purposes; provide and ensure employees use
               respirators and other PPE for exposure to people with suspected or confirmed
               COVID-19, and for aerosol-generating procedures on a person with suspected or
               confirmed COVID-19. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Aerosol-generating procedures on a person
                  with suspected or confirmed COVID-19:</span> Limit employees present to only those
               essential; perform procedures in an airborne infection isolation room, if available;
               and clean and disinfect surfaces and equipment after the procedure is completed. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"/></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Physical distancing:</span> Keep people at
               least six feet apart when indoors. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Physical barriers:</span> Install cleanable
               or disposable solid barriers at each fixed work location in non-patient care areas
               where employees are not separated from other people by at least six feet. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Cleaning and disinfection:</span> Follow
               standard practices for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces and equipment in
               accordance with CDC guidelines in patient care areas, resident rooms, and for medical
               devices and equipment; in all other areas, clean high-touch surfaces and equipment at
               least once a day and provide alcohol-based hand rub that is at least 60% alcohol or
               provide readily accessible handwashing facilities. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Ventilation:</span> Ensure that
               employer-owned or controlled existing HVAC systems are used in accordance with
               manufacturer's instructions and design specifications for the systems and that air
               filters are rated Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) 13 or higher if the
               system allows it. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Health screening and medical
                  management:</span> (1) Screen employees before each shift (a sample form is
               available <a class="xref" href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA4132.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>); (2) require each employee to
               promptly notify the company when they're COVID-19 positive, suspected of having
               COVID-19, or experiencing certain symptoms; (3) notify certain employees within 24
               hours when a person who has been in the workplace is COVID-19 positive (a sample form
               is available <a class="xref" href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA4131.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>); (4) follow requirements for
               removing employees from the workplace; and (5) employers with more than 10 employees
               must provide paid time off to workers who must isolate or quarantine. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Vaccination:</span> Provide reasonable time
               and paid leave for vaccinations and vaccine side effects. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Training:</span> Ensure all employees receive
               training so they comprehend COVID-19 transmission, tasks and situations in the
               workplace that could result in infection, and relevant policies and procedures. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Anti-retaliation:</span> Inform employees of
               their rights to the protections required by the standard and do not discharge or in
               any manner discriminate against employees for exercising their rights under the ETS
               or for engaging in actions required by the standard. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"/></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Penalty-free:</span> Requirements must be
               implemented at no cost to employees. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"/></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Recordkeeping:</span> Establish a COVID-19
               log (if more than 10 employees) of all employee instances of COVID-19 without regard
               to occupational exposure and follow requirements for making records available to
               employees/representatives. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Reporting to OSHA:</span> Report work-related
               COVID-19 fatalities and in-patient hospitalizations to OSHA. </span></li>
