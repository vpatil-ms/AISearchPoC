      <p class="p">The Illinois Department of Labor has published guidance on a new law that will require employers to provide employees with up to 40 hours of paid leave that they may use for any reason. The law takes effect January 1, 2024.</p>

      <section class="section" id="bzw1697020624287__section_x4w_xyr_bzb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Provided in the form of <a class="xref" href="https://labor.illinois.gov/faqs/paidleavefaq.html" target="_blank">answers to
               frequently asked questions</a> , the guidance is intended to clarify and highlight
            various aspects of the law and is being updated periodically. Here are some key
            takeaways from the current version of the guidance.</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="bzw1697020624287__ul_vj5_zyr_bzb">
            <li><span class="li">Both full-time and part-time workers are covered by the law. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Accrual begins upon starting employment or January 1, 2024, whichever is later.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employees are entitled to begin using the paid leave under the law 90 days following
               commencement of their employment or March 31, 2024, whichever is later. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employer may only make an employee repay borrowed accrued leave if it is
               disclosed in the employer's written paid leave policy and the employee agrees to that
               policy in writing prior to taking any leave. All payroll deductions must comply with
               the requirements of the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The law doesn't require payout of unused leave unless the leave is credited to the
               employee's paid time off bank or employee vacation account; however, employers should
               additionally consider their vacation payout obligations under the Illinois Wage
               Payment and Collection Act. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">An employer that already offers paid leave benefits that meet the minimum requirements
            of the law doesn't have to provide additional paid time off.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="bzw1697020624287__note_wj5_zyr_bzb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>This is somewhat different wording than the law itself. Under the law, an employer
               that provides any type of paid leave policy that offers at least 40 hours of paid
               leave isn't required to modify the policy if the policy offers an employee the
               option, at the employee's discretion, to take paid leave for any reason. Employers
               may want to consult legal counsel if they intend to use an existing paid leave policy
               to comply with the law.</p>
