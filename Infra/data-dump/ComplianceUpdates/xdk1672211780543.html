      <p class="p">The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) has issued final rules addressing the state's new paid sick leave requirements under the Healthy Families and Workplaces Act of 2020 (HFWA).</p>

      <section class="section" id="xdk1672211780543__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">Colorado enacted the HFWA (Senate Bill 20-205) in July 2020 to require employers to provide paid sick leave and public health emergency leave to employees. The leave must be paid at least at the same rate the employee normally earns during worked hours.</p>
<p class="p">The HFWA includes three components:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Paid sick leave.</span> Effective January 1,
               2021, employers with 16 or more employees must provide paid sick leave to their
               employees. For employers with 15 or fewer employees, the paid sick leave requirement
               takes effect January 1, 2022. Paid sick leave must accrue at a rate of at least one
               hour for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 48 hours. Accrual begins when
               employment starts or the applicable effective date, whichever is later. However,
               employers have the option of providing all the paid sick leave at the beginning of
               the year, a practice commonly known a frontloading. Employees are entitled to carry
               over up to 48 hours of unused paid sick leave to the following year. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Public health emergency leave.</span> In
               addition to the paid sick leave outlined above, employers must provide public health
               emergency leave (PHEL). Employees who normally work 40 hours or more per week are
               entitled to at least 80 hours of PHEL. Those who normally work fewer than 40 hours in
               a week are entitled to at least the greater of either the amount of time the employee
               is scheduled to work in a 14-day period or the amount of time the employee actually
               works during an average 14-day period. Employees are only eligible for PHEL once
               during the entirety of the public health emergency, even if it's amended or extended.
               Employees may use PHEL until four weeks after the official public health emergency.
               Employers may count an employee's unused paid sick leave toward the PHEL the law
               requires. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">COVID-19 emergency paid sick leave.</span>
               Through December 31, 2020, all employers must provide each employee with emergency
               paid sick leave for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the amounts and for
               the purposes specified in the emergency paid sick leave provisions of the federal
                  <a class="xref" href="https://sbshrs.adpinfo.com/covid19-stimulus-package" target="_blank">Families First Coronavirus Response Act
                  (FFCRA)</a>. Since the FFCRA already covers employers with fewer than 500
               employees, the HFWA effectively extends the emergency paid sick leave requirements to
               larger employers so that all employers in the state must now comply with the FFCRA
               leave requirements. However, the FFCRA also included an exception under which an
               employer of a healthcare provider or an emergency responder may elect to exclude the
               employee from the federal emergency paid sick leave requirement. As a result of the
               HFWA, these employees are now entitled to emergency paid sick leave in Colorado.
               Additionally, under the FFCRA, employers with fewer than 50 employees may be eligible
               to claim an exemption from the FFRCA's requirement to provide paid leave to an
               employee who is caring for their child due to their school or place of care being
               closed, or their childcare provider is unavailable, for COVID-19 related reasons if
               it would jeopardize the viability of the business. Under the HFWA, small employers in
               Colorado cannot claim that exemption. </span></li>

      <section class="section" id="xdk1672211780543__section_N1006B_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Final Rules:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Effective January 1, 2021, the final rules make the following
            clarifications.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">16-Employee Threshold:</span></p>

         <p class="p">To determine whether an employer meets the 16-employee threshold for
            HFWA coverage in 2021, the rules for how to count employees under the federal Family and
            Medical Leave Act apply:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employer must employ the requisite number of employees for each
               working day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding
               calendar year; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Any employee whose name appears on the employer's payroll will be
               considered employed each working day of the calendar week, and must be counted
               whether or not the employee received any compensation for the week; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employees on paid or unpaid leave, including sick or medical leave,
               leaves of absence, and disciplinary suspension, are counted as long as the employer
               has a reasonable expectation that the employee will later return to active
               employment; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employees are counted if they're in any state, the District of
               Columbia, or any territory of the United States. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Accrual and Carryover:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Paid sick leave begins to accrue at the start of employment or on
            January 1, 2021, whichever is later.</p>

         <p class="p">For the minimum HFWA accrual rate of one hour of leave for every 30
            hours worked, accrual is based on all <span class="q">“time worked”</span> with regular
            and overtime hours counting equally. However, an overtime-exempt employee accrues paid
            leave based on their normal hours worked up to a maximum of 40 per week.</p>

         <p class="p">On the day a public health emergency is declared, employers are required
            to immediately provide each employee with additional hours of paid leave. Employers must
            provide employees with a one-time supplemental number of hours which, when added to what
            the employee has already accrued for the year, will provide them with access to 80 hours
            of total paid leave. Employees who normally work fewer than 40 hours in a week are
            entitled to the greater of either the amount of time the employee is scheduled to work
            in a 14-day period or the amount of time the employee actually works during an average
            14-day period.</p>

         <p class="p">Employees are entitled to carryover up to 48 hours of accrued, unused
            leave to the following year, but employers may allow employees to carryover more.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Rate of Pay During Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The final rules clarify that the leave must be paid at least at the same
            rate the employee normally earns during worked hours <span class="ph em">and</span> at
            least the applicable minimum wage.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Increments:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers may limit employees to using HFWA leave in hourly increments,
            but employers may allow smaller increments. If an employer doesn't specify the minimum
            increment in writing, employees may not use increments smaller than six minutes.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Existing Leave Policies:</span></p>

         <p class="p">HFWA doesn't require additional leave if an employer policy provides
            fully paid leave for both HFWA and non-HFWA purposes (such as sick time and vacation)
            and the employer makes clear to employees, in writing and distributed in advance of an
            actual or anticipated leave request, that:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Its leave policy provides at least the amount of time off with pay
               sufficient to satisfy HFWA and applicable rules (including, if a public health
               emergency is declared and a supplemental amount of leave is required to satisfy the
               law); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Its leave policy permits employees to take leave for all the same
               purposes covered by HFWA and applicable rules, not a narrower set of purposes; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Its leave policy permits employees to take leave under all the same
               conditions as under HFWA and applicable rules, not stricter or more onerous
               conditions (including but not limited to accrual, use, payment, annual carryover of
               unused accrued leave, notice and documentation requirements, and anti-retaliation and
               anti-interference rights); and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Additional HFWA leave will need not be provided when an employee
               uses all of their available paid time off for non-HFWA-qualifying reasons (such as
               vacation), except if a public health emergency is declared after an employee uses
               some or all available paid time off for the applicable benefit year, the employer
               must supplement the employee's current total of accrued, unused leave. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Documentation:</span></p>

         <p class="p">For absences of four or more consecutive workdays, employers may require
            reasonable documentation that the leave is for a covered purpose. The final rules
            clarify that this is defined as four consecutive days on which the employee would have
            worked, not four consecutive calendar days. See the <a class="xref" href="https://cdle.colorado.gov/sites/cdle/files/7%20CCR%201103-7%20Wage%20Protection%20Rules%20ADOPTED%20%28Clean%29.pdf" target="_blank">text of the rule</a> for details on the types of
            documentation employers may require.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="xdk1672211780543__note_N100D2_N1006B_N10041_N10001"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employers are prohibited from requiring any documentation for leave
               related to a public health emergency.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Leave Statements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The final rules clarify that upon an employee's request, an employer
            must provide, in writing or electronically, documents sufficient to show, or a dated
            statement containing, the then-current amount of paid leave the employee has:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Available for use (including accrued leave); and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Already used during the current benefit year, including information
               as to any supplemental leave provided and used. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Employees may make such requests no more than once per month, except
            they may make an additional request when any need for HFWA leave arises. Employers may
            choose a reasonable system for fulfilling such requests, including but not limited to
            listing such information on each pay stub, or using an electronic system where employees
            can access their own information, or providing the necessary information in a letter or
            electronic communication.</p>
