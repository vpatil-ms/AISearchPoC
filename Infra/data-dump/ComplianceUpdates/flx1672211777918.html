      <p class="p">California has enacted legislation (Assembly Bill 2992) that expands
         domestic violence leave protections to an employee and certain family members who are
         victims of a crime. Assembly Bill 2992 takes effect <span class="ph strong">January 1,
            2021</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="flx1672211777918__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">Under Section 230 of the California Labor Code, employers are prohibited from taking adverse action against an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking for taking time off from work to help ensure their (or their child's) health, safety, or welfare.</p>
<p class="p">Additionally, under Section 230.1, employers with 25 or more employees must also provide up to 12 workweeks of leave in a 12-month period to an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking for the following purposes:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">To seek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program, or rape crisis center as a result of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To obtain psychological counseling related to an experience of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To participate in safety planning and take other actions to increase safety from future domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, including temporary or permanent relocation. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Employers must notify employees of their rights under the law in writing. The information must be provided to new employees upon hire and to other employees upon request. The Labor Commissioner publishes a sample notice that employers may use to comply with this requirement.</p>

            <li><span class="li">An individual whose immediate family member is deceased as the direct result of a crime. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The law defines immediate family member as:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Regardless of age, a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, or legal ward, a child of a domestic partner, a child to whom the employee stands as a parent, or a person to whom the employee stood as a parent when the person was a minor. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A biological, adoptive, or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of an employee or an employee's spouse or domestic partner, or a person who stood as a parent when the employee or the employee's spouse or domestic partner was a minor child. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A person to whom the employee is legally married under the laws of any state, or a domestic partner of an employee as registered under the laws of any state or political subdivision. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A biological, foster, or adoptive sibling, a stepsibling, or a half-sibling. </span></li>

When an unscheduled absence occurs, any of the following constitutes sufficient certification if provided within a reasonable amount of time after the absence:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A police report; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A court order; </span></li>
