      <p class="p">The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) has released a revised Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability Form (CC-305). Federal contractors must implement the <a class="xref" href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/self-id-forms" target="_blank">new form</a> by July 25, 2023.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jwi1684314544279__section_a5h_cd1_txb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">By way of background, federal contractors must invite applicants to self-identify as an
            individual with a disability (IWD) at both the pre-offer and post-offer phases of the
            application process. Contractors must also invite their employees to self-identify as
            IWDs every five years.</p>

         <p class="p">Federal contractors must use the Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability Form
            (CC-305) to meet these requirements.</p>

         <p class="p">The OFCCP recently revised the form to update the preferred language for disabilities
            and to include additional examples of disabilities. Contractors have until July 25, 2023
            to start using it.</p>

         <p class="p">The only content of the form that contractors may modify or delete is the <span class="q">“For
               Employer Use Only”</span> section, which was added to give contractors flexibility to
            enhance their recordkeeping for data analysis required by the OFCCP's regulations.</p>
