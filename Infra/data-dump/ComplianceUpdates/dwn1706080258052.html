      <p class="p">The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) recently issued guidance on changes to the state's pay transparency rules.</p>

      <section class="section" id="dwn1706080258052__section_oy2_vxb_f1c"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p subHeading1">Background</p>

         <p class="p">In 2023, Colorado enacted legislation that amended the state's rules for pay and
            opportunity transparency in internal and external job postings. The amendments took
            effect January 1, 2024.</p>

         <p class="p">Under the amended law, employers must disclose all job opportunities (not just promotion
            opportunities) to all employees (with the required disclosures as set forth below), in
            addition to disclosing who was selected for the role. An employer is not required to
            have an external posting, but if they do, they must follow all the disclosure
            requirements.</p>

         <p class="p">However, if an employer is only physically located outside of Colorado and has fewer
            than fifteen employees working in Colorado, all of whom work remotely, then through July
            1, 2029, the employer is only required to provide notice of remote job
            opportunities.</p>

         <p class="p">An employer must in good faith disclose the following in the notification of each job
            opportunity:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="dwn1706080258052__ul_wmn_2yb_f1c">
            <li><span class="li">The hourly or salary compensation or range of the hourly or salary pay. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A general description of benefits and other compensation applicable to the job
               opportunity. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The date the application window is expected to close. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Employers must make reasonable efforts to announce, post, or otherwise make known,
            within 30 calendar days after a candidate who is selected to fill a job opportunity
            begins working, the following information to, at a minimum, the employees with whom the
            selected candidate is expected to work regularly:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="dwn1706080258052__ul_xmn_2yb_f1c">
            <li><span class="li">The name of the selected candidate; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The selected candidate's former job title if hired from within the company; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The selected candidate's new job title; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Information on how employees may express interest in similar future opportunities,
               including who to reach out to for more information. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The law doesn't require identification of the selected candidate in any manner that
            would violate their privacy rights or would place their health or safety at risk.</p>

         <p class="p">A <span class="q">“job opportunity”</span> is defined as a current or anticipated vacancy for which the
            employer is considering candidates or interviewing candidates, or that the employer
            externally posts. The definition of <span class="q">“job opportunity”</span> excludes:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="dwn1706080258052__ul_ymn_2yb_f1c">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="q">“Career progression,”</span> which is defined as a regular or automatic movement from
               one position to another based on time in a specific role or other objective metrics. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="q">“Career development,”</span> which is defined as a change to an employee's terms of
               compensation, benefits, full-time or part-time status, duties, or access to further
               advancement in order to update the employee's job title or to compensate the employee
               to reflect work performed or contributions already made by the employee. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Recently Issued Guidance</p>

         <p class="p">The <a class="xref" href="https://cdle.colorado.gov/sites/cdle/files/INFO%20%239A%20Transparency%20in%20Pay%20and%20Job%20Opportunities_%20The%20Colorado%20EPEWA%20Part%202%2012.8.23.pdf" target="_blank">CDLE's guidance</a> addresses the amendments to the pay
            transparency rules and provides additional clarifications.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading2">Career Development Exception</p>

         <p class="p">The CDLE's guidance clarifies that for the career development exception to apply, the
            existing work or contributions must be part of the employee's existing job and aren't a
            part of a different position with a current or anticipated vacancy. Employers aren't
            required to send job opportunity notices of career development position changes.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading2">Career Progression Exception</p>

         <p class="p">The guidance also clarifies that for positions subject to the career progression
            exception, employers must provide a career progression notice to all eligible employees.
            The notice must include the requirements for career progression and each position's
            terms of compensation, benefits, full-time or part-time status, duties, and access to
            further advancement. Eligible employees are defined as <span class="q">“those in the position that,
               when the requirements in the notice are satisfied, would move from their position to
               another position listed in the notice as a 'career progression.'”</span></p>

         <p class="p subHeading2">Application Deadline</p>

         <p class="p">The guidance also addresses two exceptions to the requirement to disclose the
            application deadline. If the employer discloses that it accepts ongoing applications, no
            deadline is required. An application deadline may also be extended if the original
            deadline was a good-faith expectation of what the deadline would be, and the posting is
            promptly updated with any deadline extension.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading2">Temporary Hires</p>

         <p class="p">A job opportunity notice isn't required for acting, interim, or temporary (AINT)
            positions of up to nine months — unless the same position was held by an AINT hire for
            seven months of the previous year, according to the guidance. Other employees must be
            notified if an AINT hire is for a position not scheduled to end in nine months.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading2">Post Selection Notification</p>

         <p class="p">The guidance also clarifies the post-selection notice requirements. If an employee
            informs their employer in writing, on their own initiative, and voluntarily that they
            believe disclosing their name and/or former job title would put their health or safety
            at risk, the employer must not disclose that information. Employees need not disclose
            what the risk is, or why they believe there is a risk, and employers must not interfere
            with or retaliate against an employee who exercises this right. If this opt-out is
            exercised, an employer must still provide a post-selection notice to employees that the
            position is filled and inform them how they can express interest in future job
            opportunities.</p>
