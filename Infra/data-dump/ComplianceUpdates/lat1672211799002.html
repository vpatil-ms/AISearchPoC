The rules are in effect from December 29, 2021 to April 21, 2022.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="lat1672211799002__section_N1004E_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Covered Employers:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The emergency rules cover recreation, entertainment, historical and
            cultural establishments, along with retail and service businesses, restaurants and bars,
            venues of religious and faith-based organizations, catered events, and office-based and
            other public and private employers.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Masking Requirements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Establishments with indoor capacities of 250 or more people must require
            everyone to wear a mask while indoors, regardless of their vaccination status. Those
            with a capacity of fewer than 250 people may exempt a person from the indoor mask
            requirement if the person can provide proof of vaccination. Under the rules, capacity is
            the maximum number of people allowed by the fire marshal, not the actual number of
            people present.</p>

         <p class="p">For catered events, capacity is the number of guests in attendance. In
            these events, if there are more than 250 guests, everyone must be masked, regardless of
            vaccination status. However, if there are fewer than 250 guests, the event host and/or
            venue operator must implement either: (1) an event-wide indoor masking requirement; (2)
            a proof of vaccination requirement; or (3) require individuals to either show proof of
            vaccination or wear masks indoors.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Notice Requirements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must post a sign about the mask requirement at all entrances
            of an establishment as well as information on proof of vaccination requirements, if
            applicable. Although Rhode Island's Department of Health provides examples of
            appropriate posters (<a class="xref" href="https://health.ri.gov/publications/posters/Masks-Required.pdf" target="_blank">Masks</a>,<a class="xref" href="https://health.ri.gov/publications/posters/Proof-of-Vaccination-Required.pdf" target="_blank">Proof of Vaccination</a>, and<a class="xref" href="https://health.ri.gov/publications/posters/Mask-or-Proof-of-Vaccination-Required.pdf" target="_blank">Masks or Proofs of Vaccination</a>), an employer
            can also create their own poster. Those that do must include one of the following
            applicable statements on their poster in bold print:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A MASK OR PROOF OF VACCINATION IS REQUIRED IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">MASKS ARE REQUIRED IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">PROOF OF VACCINATION IS REQUIRED IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Enforcement:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Each individual violation of the rules may result in a penalty of up to
            $500, and every individual that is allowed to enter a premise against the rules counts
            as a separate and distinct violation.</p>
