      <p class="p">California has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 1383) that expands the
         California Family Rights Act to cover more workers and make other changes to the law.

In cases in which both eligible parents are employed by the same employer, the parents are entitled to a combined total of 12 weeks of leave if it's to bond with a new child. To be eligible for CFRA leave, employees must:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Have more than 12 months of service with the employer; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Have at least 1,250 hours of service with the employer during the
               previous 12-month period; <span class="ph em">and</span></span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Work at a worksite in which the employer employs at least 50 employees within 75 miles. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Under the New Parent Leave Act (NPLA), employers with 20 or more employees must provide eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of parental leave to bond with a new child.</p>
