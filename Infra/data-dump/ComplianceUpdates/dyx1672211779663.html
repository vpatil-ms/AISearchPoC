      <p class="p">The Maryland Department of Labor (MDOL) has provided guidance on a new requirement for restaurant employers to provide a tip credit wage statement to tipped employees.</p>

      <section class="section" id="dyx1672211779663__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">In 2019, Maryland enacted legislation (Senate Bill 280) to, among other things, direct the MDOL to adopt regulations that require restaurants that apply the tip credit toward the minimum wage to provide tipped employees with a wage statement each pay period that shows the effective hourly tip rate. The regulations, which took effect October 1, 2020, define key terms and state:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">No later than two weeks following the end of the pay period, a restaurant employer must provide each employee for whom the employer uses a tip credit with a wage statement for each pay period that reflects all reported tips for tip credit hours for each workweek of the pay period. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employer may satisfy the requirement by providing an online system through which an employee may obtain the employee's tip credit wage statement. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="dyx1672211779663__section_N1005D_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">New Guidance:</h2><p class="p">The MDOL has published new guidance in the form of answers to frequently asked questions. Some examples include:</p>

      <section class="section" id="dyx1672211779663__section_N10067_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Q: Does the tip credit wage statement need to be provided at the same time as the pay stub?</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> No. The tip credit wage statement does not need to be provided
            at the same time as the pay stub but it must be provided no later than two weeks
            following the end of the pay period.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="dyx1672211779663__section_N10075_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Q: Can the tip credit wage statement be provided electronically?</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> Yes. The tip credit wage statement can be electronic or
            written.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="dyx1672211779663__section_N10083_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Q: What additional information must employers provide along with the effective hourly tip rate of pay on tip credit wage statements?</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> Yes. However, because of the requirement to provide this
            information for each workweek of the pay period, employers will need to break down
            payroll information for tip credit employees by workweek when reporting pay period
            information to payroll service providers if the employer wants the payroll service to
            include this information with employee pay stubs/statements.</p>

      <section class="section" id="dyx1672211779663__section_N10091_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Q: How long does the tip credit wage statement need to be retained? Does this need to be retained with the employees' payroll records?</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">A:</span> Like other payroll records, the tip credit wage statement should
            be retained for at least three years.</p>
