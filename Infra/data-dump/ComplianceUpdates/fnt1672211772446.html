      <p class="p">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has issued a temporary policy regarding expired documents used for Form I-9 purposes. The I-9 is used to verify a new hire's identity and work authorization.</p>

      <section class="section" id="fnt1672211772446__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">To complete Section 2 of the I-9, employees must present unexpired documents that
            verify their identity and employment authorization. The I-9 Form includes a List of
            Acceptable Documents (List A, List B, and List C). An employee must present one document
            from List A or one document from List B and <span class="ph em">one</span> document from
            List C.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">List A documents: establish both identity and employment authorization </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">List B documents: establish identity only </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">List C documents: establish employment authorization only </span></li>

         <p class="p">On May 1, 2020, the DHS issued a temporary policy to address the
            challenges individuals may experience when renewing a state driver's license, a state ID
            card, or other List B identity document due to the restrictions put in place for
            COVID-19.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Documents set to expire without extensions from
               issuing authority:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Beginning May 1, 2020, identity documents found in List B set to expire
            on or after <span class="ph strong">March 1, 2020</span>, and not otherwise extended by
            the issuing authority (such as the state DMV), may be treated the same as if the
            employee presented a <a class="xref" href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/acceptable-documents/receipts" target="_blank">valid receipt</a> for an acceptable document.</p>

         <p class="p">In such cases, the employer should:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Record the document information in Section 2 under List B, as
               applicable; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Enter the word <span class="q">“COVID-19”</span> in the Additional
               Information Field. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <div class="note note" id="fnt1672211772446__note_N10089_N10061_N10041_N10001"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>If the List B document expired before March 1, 2020, the temporary
               policy won't apply, and the employer won't be able to accept it.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p">Within 90 days after the DHS's termination of this temporary policy, the
            employee must present a valid unexpired document to replace the expired document
            presented when they were initially hired. If necessary, the employee may choose to
            present a different List A or List B document(s) and you would then record the new
            document information in the additional Information field.</p>

         <p class="p">When the employee later presents an unexpired document, in the Section 2
            Additional information field you should:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Record the number and other required document information from the
               actual document presented; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Initial and date the change. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Documents set to expire with extensions from
               issuing authority:</span></p>

         <p class="p">If the employee's List B identity document expired on or after <span class="ph strong">March 1, 2020</span>, and the issuing authority has extended the
            document expiration date due to COVID-19, the document is acceptable as a List B
            document (and is not considered a receipt) during the extension timeframe specified by
            the issuing authority. Note: If the List B document expired before March 1, 2020, the
            temporary policy won't apply, and the employer won't be able to accept it.</p>

         <p class="p">In such cases, employers should:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Enter the document's expiration date in Section 2; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Enter <span class="q">“COVID-19 EXT”</span> in the Additional
               Information Field. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Employers may also attach a copy of a webpage or other notice indicating
            that the issuing authority has extended the document expiration, such as the state DMV
            website. For extended documents, the employee isn't required to later present a valid
            unexpired document to verify identity.</p>

         <p class="p">E-Verify:</p>

         <p class="p">E-Verify participating employers should use the employee's expired List
            B document number from Section 2 of the Form I-9 to create an E-Verify case as usual
            within three days of the date of hire.</p>

At this time, the DHS hasn't relaxed current I-9 standards related to expiring employment authorization documents.</p>
