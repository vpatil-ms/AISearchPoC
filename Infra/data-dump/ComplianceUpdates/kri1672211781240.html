      <p class="p">Utah Governor Gary Herbert has issued Executive Order 75, which requires employers to follow certain COVID-19 related safety requirements for the duration of the public health emergency. The Order is effective immediately.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">General Requirements:</h2><p class="p">Under the Order, businesses must require each:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Employee and contractor to wear a face mask while at work; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Patron who enters a business premise to wear a face mask, including at doors and entrances; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Separate household group at a business, or each separate party at a bar or restaurant, to maintain at least six feet of physical distance from others, including at doors and entrances. </span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employee Mask Requirements:</h2><p class="p">An employee's mask must cover their nose and mouth, be made of synthetic or natural fabrics and rest snugly against an employee's nose, sides of the face, and under the chin. The Order expressly prohibits face masks made of web-like materials (mesh, lace, and crochet) or masks with openings, such as vents, exhalation valves, or other gaps.</p>
<p class="p">Employees may remove their masks in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">While actively eating or drinking; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">While solely occupying a room, cubicle, or similar enclosure; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When communicating with a person who is deaf or hard of hearing, if communication cannot be achieved through other means and the speaker wears a face shield or uses alternative protection such as a plexiglass barrier; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">While obtaining or providing a service that requires the temporary removal of the mask; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">While swimming or on duty as a lifeguard; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">While giving a religious, political, media, educational, artistic, cultural, musical, or theatrical presentation for an audience; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When engaging in work in which wearing a mask would create a risk to the person, while following government safety guidelines; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When it's necessary to confirm a person's identity; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When federal or state laws or regulations prohibit wearing a face mask; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If they're prevented from wearing a mask due to a medical or mental health condition or an intellectual or developmental disability. </span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Sign Requirements:</h2><p class="p">Employers must post signage in a conspicuous location that:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Provides notice of face mask and physical distancing requirements; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Asks employees and customers experiencing COVID-19 symptoms to stay home; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Lists COVID-19 symptoms. </span></li>

         </ul>
