      <p class="p">Colorado's state-run retirement program, called Colorado SecureSavings, is set to launch in early 2023. Employers with five or more employees must either facilitate the program or offer a qualifying retirement plan to employees.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ivr1679044756911__section_dyc_1bl_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Colorado SecureSavings is a state-run payroll withholding savings program using
            Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). The program doesn't require, or even allow,
            employers to contribute to the IRAs. However, unless exempt, employers are required to
            facilitate the program by registering, enrolling employees, and withholding/remitting
            employee contributions.</p>

         <p class="p">Colorado businesses must facilitate Colorado SecureSavings if they:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="ivr1679044756911__ul_rsr_bbl_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Have been in business for two or more years; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employ five or more employees who have worked for them for at least 180 days; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Don't already offer a retirement savings plan for any employees. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Employers should receive notices directly from Colorado SecureSavings via mail or email
            when the program is <a class="xref" href="https://coloradosecuresavings.com/employers/program-details" target="_blank">open for registration and enrollment</a> in early 2023. The notices will have an
            access code for employers to use when registering and should include a deadline. If
            employers already offer a qualifying retirement plan but still receive a notice, they
            will need to certify that they are exempt by the deadline.</p>

         <p class="p">To register or claim exemption, employers will need their EIN and access code for
            Colorado SecureSavings. After registering, covered employers will have to provide
            employee information and payroll information to enroll employees. The Colorado
            SecureSavings portal will then send each employee a notification. Employees will have 30
            days to decide to stay enrolled, opt out of participating, or customize their account
            settings. After this 30-day opt-out period, employers will need to start payroll
            deductions for employees who choose to remain in the program.</p>
