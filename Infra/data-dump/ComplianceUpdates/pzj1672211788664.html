      <p class="p">Maryland has enacted legislation (House Bill 581) requiring <span class="q">“essential employers”</span> to take certain steps during a public health emergency, including providing paid leave to essential employees if public funding becomes available. House Bill 581 is effective immediately.</p>

      <section class="section" id="pzj1672211788664__section_N1004C_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Covered Employers and Workers:</h2><p class="p">House Bill 581 applies only to employers that are identified by the governor or a state or federal agency as critical to remain in operation during an emergency. To be covered by the law, the worker must be considered an essential employee. This means an individual who performs work during the emergency that must be completed at the worksite and whom the employer deems essential to its operations.</p>

      <section class="section" id="pzj1672211788664__section_N10056_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Requirements:</h2><p class="p">Covered employers must:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Provide working conditions that comply with applicable safety standards. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Furnish personal protective equipment at no cost to essential workers. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Adopt, maintain, and post written protocols to ensure essential workers have access to information on the applicable safety standards in effect during the emergency. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">If <span class="ph strong">any</span> worker has contracted COVID-19, the covered
            employer must take the following actions:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Inform essential workers that they may have been exposed; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Cover the cost of COVID-19 testing to essential workers if they're unable to obtain testing free of charge; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Report all positive tests to the Maryland Department of Health. </span></li>

      <section class="section" id="pzj1672211788664__section_N10081_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Right to Refuse Work:</h2><p class="p">Under certain conditions, an essential worker has a right to refuse to perform an assigned task and is protected from discharge or other discrimination by the employer if they refuse a task. This protection applies in the following situations:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">An employee is confronted with a choice between not performing an
               assigned task or being subjected to serious injury or death arising from a hazardous
               condition at the workplace, has no reasonable alternative, and refuses in good faith
               to be exposed to the dangerous condition; <span class="ph strong">and</span></span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The condition causing the employee's apprehension is of such a nature that a reasonable individual would conclude that there's a real danger of death or serious injury, there is insufficient time to rectify the situation, and the employee, if possible, has sought correction of the dangerous conditions from the employer and has been unable to obtain a correction. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="pzj1672211788664__section_N10096_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Leave:</h2><p class="p">If the federal or state government provides funding that can be used for public health emergency leave, then each essential employer must provide an essential worker with public health emergency leave on the date the funding is made available. This leave is in addition to any other leave, including leave required by the Maryland Healthy Working Families Act (MHWFA). If specified in a federal program, order, law, or regulation, the amount of leave provided must equal what's outlined within that particular requirement. Otherwise, a full-time essential worker who regularly works 40 hours or more per week must be provided with 112 hours of leave.</p>
<p class="p">If/when the requirement takes effect, essential employees may use the leave for the following purposes:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">To isolate when the employee has been diagnosed with the disease or is experiencing symptoms and awaiting a diagnosis; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To seek or obtain a medical diagnosis, preventive care, or treatment because the essential worker is diagnosed with COVID-19; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To care for a family member who is isolating because of a COVID-19 diagnosis; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Due to a determination by a public health official or healthcare professional that the essential worker's presence would jeopardize the health of other individuals because of the essential worker's exposure to, or exhibited symptoms associated with, COVID-19; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To care for a family member due to a determination by a public health official or healthcare professional that the family member's presence would jeopardize the health of others because of the family member's exposure to, or exhibited symptoms associated with, COVID-19; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">To care for a child or other family member when the care provider or school or place of care is unavailable due to the emergency. </span></li>

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Adopt the Emergency Temporary Standard related to COVID-19 issued by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If OSHA hasn't issued a standard, adopt a State Emergency Temporary Standard that meets specified requirements. </span></li>

Since <span class="q">“essential workers”</span> under state law may also include workers in other sectors, it appears the state may also have to adopt its own State Emergency Temporary Standard.</p>
