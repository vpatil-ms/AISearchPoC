      <p class="p">The District of Columbia has enacted an emergency ordinance (B23-870) that requires employers to implement certain COVID-19 related policies and prohibits retaliation against employees for certain COVID-19 related scenarios. The ordinance took effect immediately and expires on November 10, 2020.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kpv1672211775800__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">COVID-19 Policies:</h2><p class="p">Employers in the District of Columbia must adopt and implement social distancing and worker protection policies to prevent transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace that adhere to the requirements of <a class="xref" href="https://coronavirus.dc.gov/maskorder" target="_blank">Mayor's Order 2020-080</a>, or a subsequent Mayor's Order.</p>
<p class="p">Mayor's Order 2020-080 relates to masks and generally requires employers to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Post signage on their exterior doors stating that a person may not enter unless they are wearing a mask. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Exclude or attempt to eject individuals who aren't wearing masks or who remove their masks. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide masks to their employees. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The new law allows an employer to establish a policy requiring an employee to report to the employer a positive test for an active COVID-19 infection. However, employers are expressly prohibited from disclosing the identity of an employee who tests positive except to the Department of Health or another District or federal agency responsible for and engaged in contact tracing and the containment of community spread of COVID-19.</p>
