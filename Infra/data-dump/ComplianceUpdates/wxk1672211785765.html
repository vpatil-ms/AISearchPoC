      <p class="p">Virginia has enacted legislation (House Bill 2063 also known as the Overtime
         Wage Act) that expands overtime protections. House Bill 2063 is effective <span class="ph strong">July 1, 2021</span>.</p>

      <p class="p"/>

      <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Updated August 2021:</span> The Virginia Department
         of Labor and Industries has released FAQs on the Act available <a class="xref" href="https://www.doli.virginia.gov/labor-law/faqs-virginia-overtime-law/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wxk1672211785765__section_N10053_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires employers to pay non-exempt
               <span class="ph em">employees</span> at least the minimum wage per hour and 1.5 times
            their regular rate of pay (overtime pay) whenever they work more than 40 hours in a
            workweek.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Hourly employees:</span></p>
<p class="p">To determine an employee's regular rate of pay for overtime purposes, the FLSA uses a standard formula: all payment for employment, with certain exclusions permitted by law, divided by all hours worked in the workweek.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Salaried non-exempt employees:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers may pay non-exempt employees on a salary basis as long as the employee is paid at least the minimum wage for all hours worked and overtime when due. Under the FLSA, calculating a salaried non-exempt employee's regular rate of pay for overtime purposes depends on the number of hours the employer and employee understand that the salary is intended to cover. For example, if the employer and employee understand the salary to cover 45 hours, then the employer may calculate the regular rate of pay by dividing the weekly salary by 45 hours.</p>

      <section class="section" id="wxk1672211785765__section_N10069_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">House Bill 2063:</h2><p class="p">The Overtime Wage Act (the Act) adds additional protections for salaried non-exempt employees and stricter penalties for employer violations than what is currently covered under the FLSA.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Regular rate calculations:</span></p>
<p class="p">For salaried non-exempt employees, the Act establishes a new formula for calculating the regular
            rate of pay: one-fortieth of all wages paid to an employee for that workweek.
            Ultimately, the new formula prevents employers from paying non-exempt employees a fixed
            salary that only covers straight-time wages for hours in excess of 40 hours in a
            workweek, or from using the FLSA's <span class="q">“<a class="xref" href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/opinion-letters/FLSA/2020_08_31_14_FLSA.pdf" target="_blank">fluctuating workweek</a>”</span> method for calculating
            overtime.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Statute of limitations &amp;amp; penalties:</span></p>
<p class="p">The Act also increases the amount of time an employee can claim an overtime violation from two years, under the FLSA, to three years and increases damages. All overtime violations are subject to double damages, or treble damages in the case of willful violation. Additionally, the <span class="q">“good faith”</span> defense that is available to employers under the FLSA is not permitted under the Act.</p>
