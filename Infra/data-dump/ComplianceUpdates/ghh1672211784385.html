      <p class="p">Michigan has enacted legislation (House Bill 4047) that will provide funding to continue and expand hazard pay for direct care workers.</p>

      <p class="p">Direct care workers employed by the following entities will be eligible for $2.25 per hour in hazard pay from March 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021:</p>

      <ul class="ul">
         <li><span class="li">The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, its contractors, and its subcontractors who received a $2 per hour state-funded hazard pay beginning in April 2020. </span></li>

         <li><span class="li">Skilled nursing facilities. </span></li>

         <li><span class="li">Area agencies on aging and their contractors for in-home and respite services. </span></li>

         <li><span class="li">Licensed adult foster care homes and licensed homes for the aged who weren't eligible for hazard pay under any other provision of House Bill 4047. </span></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="p">Direct support employees and job coaches who work in supported employment arrangements are also eligible for $2.25 in hazard pay from March 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021.</p>

      <p class="p">Front line workers employed by child-caring institutions (as defined by state law) are eligible for hazard pay of $2 per hour from March 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has established a process for employers to seek reimbursement for hazard pay provided to covered direct care workers. Employers should retain documentation (such as payroll records and job descriptions) to demonstrate direct care workers' eligibility for, and receipt of, hazard pay, and to show that other eligible expenses were actually incurred.
