      <p class="p">Utah has enacted legislation (House Bill 324), which provides an additional way for employers to help maintain a safe working environment. House Bill 324 takes effect on July 1, 2023.</p>

      <section class="section" id="kgj1682597016708__section_ics_fg3_jxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Under House Bill 324, a business that employs an individual in Utah, or an authorized
            agent of the employer, may petition for a workplace violence protective order if they
            reasonably believe workplace violence has occurred against them or an employee.</p>

         <p class="p">By way of background, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and the Utah
            OSHA require covered employers to provide a safe workplace, free from recognized hazards
            that cause or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees.</p>

         <p class="p">Under the federal OSHA, employers must take reasonable steps to prevent or abate a
            recognized violence hazard (an act or threat of physical violence, harassment,
            intimidation, or other threatening or disruptive behavior that occurs at a worksite),
            which includes verbal threats and physical acts and can involve employees, customers,
            vendors or visitors.</p>

         <p class="p">House Bill 324 defines <span class="ph strong">workplace violence</span>
            as:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="kgj1682597016708__ul_cll_gg3_jxb">
            <li><span class="li">Knowingly causing or threatening to cause bodily injury to, or significant damage to
               the property of an employer or employee performing their duties as an employee; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The action or threat would cause a reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened,
               intimidated or harassed (and in cases of a threat, that the threat will be carried
               out). </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="kgj1682597016708__section_N10066_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employer Requirements</h2><p class="p">The law adds a new method of protecting employees, by allowing an employer to petition for a workplace violence protective order if the employer has knowledge that a specific individual is the target of workplace violence. The employer must make a good-faith effort to notify the individual that a workplace violence protective order is being sought.</p>

            <li><span class="li">Stay away from the workplace. </span></li>
