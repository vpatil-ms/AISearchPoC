      <p class="p">Minnesota has enacted legislation (Senate File 2677) that requires employers of frontline workers to notify them that they may be eligible for a one-time payment from the state. The payments are meant to compensate these workers for responding to the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

      <section class="section" id="smv1679044748827__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         <p class="p">This section has been updated to reflect that a specific compliance deadline has been
            set, the state has published guidance, and the state has released a sample notice:</p>

         <p class="p">By June 23, 2022, employers in the frontline sector must provide notice advising all
            current workers of the potential benefit and how to apply for it. The Minnesota
            Department of Labor and Industry has developed a form that can be used to meet this
            requirement, which is available <a class="xref" href="https://https://www.dli.mn.gov/notice" target="_blank">here</a>. Employers
            must provide notice using the same means used to provide other work-related notices to
            employees.</p>

         <p class="p">Under the law, a frontline worker is defined as an individual employed in one of the
            following sectors:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="smv1679044748827__ul_lnx_bkj_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Long-term care and home care; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Vocational rehabilitation. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">To be eligible for the payments, frontline workers must meet the following criteria:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="smv1679044748827__ul_mnx_bkj_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Employed for at least 120 hours in Minnesota in one or more frontline sectors from
               March 15, 2020 through June 30, 2021; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Wasn't able to telework due to the nature of the individual's work and worked in
               close proximity to individuals outside of the worker's household; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Didn't receive unemployment insurance benefits for more than 20 weeks between March
