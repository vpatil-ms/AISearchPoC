            for COVID-19 Prevention Program:</h2><p class="p">Under the emergency rules,
            employers must establish, implement, and maintain an effective, <span class="ph em">written</span> COVID-19 Prevention Program, which may be integrated into the
            employer's Injury and Illness Program, or be maintained in a separate document. The DIR
            has published a model COVID-19 Prevention Program, which can be found <a class="xref" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/dosh_publications/CPP.doc" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p class="p">The written
            elements of a COVID-19 Prevention Program must include the following:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">1. System for Communicating
            Information:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers must do all of the following in a form
            readily understandable by employees:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Ask employees to report to the employer, without fear of reprisal,
               COVID-19 symptoms, possible COVID-19 exposures (see <a class="xref" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/oshsb/documents/COVID-19-Prevention-Emergency-apprvdtxt.pdf" target="_blank">text of rules</a> for definition), and
               possible COVID-19 hazards (see <a class="xref" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/oshsb/documents/COVID-19-Prevention-Emergency-apprvdtxt.pdf" target="_blank">text of rules</a> for definition), at the
               workplace. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Describe procedures or policies for accommodating employees with
               medical or other conditions that put them at increased risk of severe COVID-19
               illness. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide information about access to COVID-19 testing. If testing is
               required under these rules or another rule, the employer must inform affected
               employees of the reason for the COVID-19 testing and the possible consequences of a
               positive test. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Communicate information about COVID-19 hazards and the employer's
               COVID-19 policies and procedures to employees and to other employers, persons, and
               entities within or in contact with the employer's workplace </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">2. Identification and Evaluation of
               COVID-19 Hazards:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers must:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Allow for employee and authorized employee representative
               participation in the identification and evaluation of COVID-19 hazards. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Develop and implement a process for screening employees for and
               responding to employees with COVID-19 symptoms (see <a class="xref" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/oshsb/documents/COVID-19-Prevention-Emergency-apprvdtxt.pdf" target="_blank">text of rules</a> for definition). The
               employer may ask employees to evaluate their own symptoms before reporting to work.
               If the employer conducts screening at the workplace, the employer must ensure that
               face coverings are used during screening by both screeners and employees and, if
               temperatures are measured, that non-contact thermometers are used. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Develop policies and procedures to respond effectively and
               immediately to individuals at the workplace with a confirmed COVID-19 case (see <a class="xref" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/oshsb/documents/COVID-19-Prevention-Emergency-apprvdtxt.pdf" target="_blank">text of rules</a> for definition) to prevent
               or reduce the risk of transmission in the workplace. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Conduct a workplace-specific identification of all interactions,
               areas, activities, processes, equipment, and materials that could potentially expose
               employees to COVID-19 hazards. Employers must treat all persons, regardless of
               symptoms or negative COVID-19 test results, as potentially infectious, including:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">Identification of places and times when people may congregate
                     or come in contact with one another, regardless of whether employees are
                     performing an assigned work task, for instance during meetings or trainings and
                     including in and around entrances, bathrooms, hallways, aisles, walkways,
                     elevators, break or eating areas, and waiting areas. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">An evaluation of employees' potential exposure to all persons
                     at the workplace or who may enter the workplace, including coworkers, employees
                     of other entities, members of the public, customers or clients, and independent
                     contractors. Employers must consider how employees and other persons enter,
                     leave, and travel through the workplace, in addition to addressing fixed work
                     locations. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">For indoor locations, evaluate how to maximize the quantity of
               outdoor air and whether it is possible to increase filtration efficiency to the
               highest level compatible with the existing ventilation system. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Review applicable orders and guidance from the state and the local
               health department related to COVID-19 hazards and prevention, including information
               specific to the employer's industry, location, and operations. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Evaluate existing COVID-19 prevention controls at the workplace and
               the need for different or additional controls. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Conduct periodic inspections as needed to identify unhealthy
               conditions, work practices, and work procedures related to COVID-19 and to ensure
               compliance with employers' COVID-19 policies and procedures. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">3. Investigating and Responding to Cases
               in the Workplace:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers must:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Have an effective procedure to investigate COVID-19 cases in the
               workplace. This includes procedures for verifying COVID-19 case status, receiving
               information regarding COVID-19 test results and onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and
               identifying and recording COVID-19 cases. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Take the following actions when there has been a COVID-19 case in
               the workplace:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">Determine the day and time the COVID-19 case was last present
                     and, to the extent possible, the date of the positive COVID-19 test(s) and/or
                     diagnosis, and the date the COVID-19 case first had one or more COVID-19
                     symptoms, if any. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Determine who may have had a COVID-19 exposure. This requires
                     an evaluation of the activities of the COVID-19 case and all locations at the
                     workplace which may have been visited by the COVID-19 case during the high-risk
                     exposure period (see <a class="xref" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/oshsb/documents/COVID-19-Prevention-Emergency-apprvdtxt.pdf" target="_blank">text of rules</a> for definition). </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Give notice of the potential COVID-19 exposure, within one
                     business day, in a way that does not reveal any personal identifying
                     information of the COVID-19 case, to:<ul class="ul">
                        <li><span class="li">All employees who may have had COVID-19 exposure and
                           their authorized representatives. </span></li>

                        <li><span class="li">Independent contractors and other employers present at
                           the workplace during the high-risk exposure period. </span></li>

                     </ul>
</span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Offer COVID-19 testing at no cost, during their working hours,
                     to all employees who had potential COVID-19 exposure in the workplace and
                     provide them with the information regarding COVID-19-related benefits to which
                     the employee may be entitled under applicable federal, state, or local laws.
                     This includes any benefits available under workers' compensation law, the
                     federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act (<a class="xref" href="https://sbshrs.adpinfo.com/covid19-stimulus-package" target="_blank">FFCRA</a>), Labor Code sections <a class="xref" href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;sectionNum=248.1" target="_blank">248.1</a> and <a class="xref" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;sectionNum=248.5." target="_blank">248.5</a>, Labor Code sections <a class="xref" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB1159&amp;showamends=false" target="_blank">3212.86 through 3212.88</a>, local
                     governmental requirements, the employer's own leave policies, and leave
                     guaranteed by contract. Employers must also inform employees of the rights and
                     benefits extended to employees excluded from work under the rules and otherwise
                     able and available to work (see below). </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Investigate whether any workplace conditions could have
                     contributed to the risk of COVID-19 exposure and what could be done to reduce
                     exposure to COVID-19 hazards. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Ensure that personal identifying information of COVID-19 cases or
               persons with COVID-19 symptoms is kept confidential. All COVID-19 testing or related
               medical services provided by the employer must be provided in a manner that ensures
               employee confidentiality. Employers must also ensure that all employee medical
               records required are kept confidential and aren't disclosed or reported without the
               employee's express written consent to any person within or outside the workplace.
               However, unredacted information on COVID-19 cases and medical records must be
               provided to the local and state health department, DIR, and the National Institute
               for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), or as otherwise required by law
               immediately upon request. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">4. Correction of COVID-19
            Hazards:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers must implement effective policies and/or
            procedures for correcting unsafe or unhealthy conditions, work practices, policies and
            procedures in a timely manner based on the severity of the hazard.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">5. Training and Instruction:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers must provide effective training and instruction to employees that
            includes:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employer's policies and procedures to protect employees from
               COVID-19 hazards. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Information regarding COVID-19-related benefits to which the
               employee may be entitled under applicable federal, state, or local laws. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The fact that COVID-19 is an infectious disease that can be spread
               through the air when an infectious person talks or vocalizes, sneezes, coughs, or
               exhales; that COVID-19 may be transmitted when a person touches a contaminated object
               and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth; and that an infectious person may have
               no symptoms. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Methods of physical distancing of at least six feet and the
               importance of combining physical distancing with the wearing of face coverings. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The fact that particles containing the virus can travel more than
               six feet, especially indoors, so physical distancing must be combined with other
               controls, including face coverings and hand hygiene, to be effective. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The importance of frequent hand washing with soap and water for at
               least 20 seconds and using hand sanitizer when employees do not have immediate access
               to a sink or hand washing facility, and that hand sanitizer doesn't work if the hands
               are soiled. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Proper use of face coverings and the fact that face coverings are
               not respiratory protective equipment. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">COVID-19 symptoms, and the importance of not coming to work and
               obtaining a COVID-19 test if the employee has any COVID-19 symptoms. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">6. Physical Distancing:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employees must be separated from other persons by at least six feet,
            except where an employer can demonstrate that six feet of separation isn't possible, and
            except for momentary exposure while persons are in movement. Methods of physical
            distancing include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Telework or other remote work arrangements; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Reducing the number of persons in an area at one time, including
               visitors; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Visual cues such as signs and floor markings to indicate where
               employees and others should be located or their direction and path of travel; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Staggered arrival, departure, work, and break times; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Adjusted work processes or procedures, such as reducing production
               speed, to allow greater distance between employees. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">When it isn't possible to maintain a distance of at least six feet,
            individuals must be as far apart as possible.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">7. Face Coverings:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers must
            provide face coverings and ensure they are worn by employees over the nose and mouth
            when indoors, when outdoors and less than six feet away from another person, and where
            required by orders from the state or local health department. Employers must ensure face
            coverings are clean and undamaged. Face shields aren't a replacement for face coverings,
            although they may be worn together for additional protection.</p>
<p class="p">The
            following are exceptions to the face coverings requirement:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">When an employee is alone in a room. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">While eating and drinking at the workplace, provided employees are
               at least six feet apart and outside air supply to the area, if indoors, has been
               maximized to the extent possible. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employees wearing respiratory protection in accordance with state
               rules. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employees who cannot wear face coverings due to a medical or mental
               health condition or disability, or who are hearing-impaired or communicating with a
               hearing-impaired person. Such employees must wear an effective non-restrictive
               alternative, such as a face shield with a drape on the bottom, if their condition or
               disability permits it. Any employee not wearing a face covering, face shield with a
               drape or other effective alternative, or respiratory protection, for any reason, must
               be at least six feet apart from all other persons unless the unmasked employee is
               tested at least twice weekly for COVID-19. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Specific tasks which cannot feasibly be performed with a face
               covering. This exception is limited to the time period in which such tasks are
               actually being performed, and the unmasked employee must be at least six feet away
               from all other persons unless unmasked employees are tested at least twice weekly for
               COVID-19. </span></li>

            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The California Department of Public Health has issued guidance for
               employers that identifies examples when wearing a face covering is likely not
               feasible.</p>

         </div>
<p class="p">Employers are prohibited from preventing any employee from
            wearing a face covering when not required by the rules, unless it would create a safety
            hazard, such as interfering with the safe operation of equipment.</p>
Employers must
         implement measures to communicate to non-employees the face coverings requirements on their
         premises. Additionally, employers must implement policies and procedures to minimize
         employee exposure to COVID-19 hazards originating from any person not wearing a face
         covering, including a member of the public.<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">8.
               Other Controls and Personal Protective Equipment:</span></p>
<p class="p">At fixed
            work locations where it isn't possible to maintain the physical distancing requirement
            at all times, the employer must install cleanable solid partitions that effectively
            reduce aerosol transmission between the employee and other persons.</p>
<p class="p">For buildings with mechanical and/or natural ventilation, employers must
            maximize the quantity of outside air provided to the extent feasible, except when the
            United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality Index is greater than
            100 for any pollutant or if opening windows or letting in outdoor air by other means
            would cause a hazard to employees, for instance from excessive heat or cold.</p>
<p class="p">Employers must implement cleaning and disinfecting procedures, which
            require:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Identifying and regularly cleaning and disinfecting frequently
               touched surfaces and objects, such as doorknobs, elevator buttons, equipment, tools,
               handrails, handles, controls, bathroom surfaces, and steering wheels. The employer
               must inform employees and authorized employee representatives of cleaning and
               disinfection protocols, including the planned frequency and scope of regular cleaning
               and disinfection. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prohibiting the sharing of personal protective equipment and to the
               extent feasible, items that employees come in regular physical contact with such as
               phones, headsets, desks, keyboards, writing materials, instruments, and tools. When
               it isn't feasible to prevent sharing, it must be minimized, and such items and
               equipment must be disinfected between uses by different people. Sharing of vehicles
               must be minimized to the extent feasible, and high touch points (steering wheel, door
               handles, seatbelt buckles, armrests, shifter, etc.) must be disinfected between
               users. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Cleaning and disinfection of areas, material, and equipment used by
               a COVID-19 case during the high-risk exposure period. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">To protect employees from COVID-19 hazards, the employer must
            evaluate its handwashing facilities, determine the need for additional facilities,
            encourage and allow time for employee handwashing, and provide employees with an
            effective hand sanitizer. Employers must encourage employees to wash their hands for at
            least 20 seconds each time. The use of hand sanitizers with methyl alcohol is
            prohibited.</p>
<p class="p">Employers must evaluate the need for personal
            protective equipment to prevent exposure to COVID-19 hazards, such as gloves, goggles,
            and face shields, and provide such personal protective equipment as needed.</p>
<p class="p">Employers must evaluate the need for respiratory protection in
            accordance with state rules when the physical distancing requirements aren't feasible or
            aren't maintained. Employers must provide and ensure use of respirators in accordance
            with state rules when deemed necessary by the DIR through the Issuance of Order to Take
            Special Action.</p>
<p class="p">Employers must provide and ensure use of eye
            protection and respiratory protection in accordance with state rules when employees are
            exposed to procedures that may aerosolize potentially infectious material such as saliva
            or respiratory tract fluids.</p>

               Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Access:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers must:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Report information about COVID-19 cases at the workplace to the
               local health department whenever required by law and must provide any related

            <li><span class="li">Make the written COVID-19 Prevention Program available at the
               workplace to employees, authorized employee representatives, and to representatives
               of the DIR immediately upon request. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Keep a record of and track all COVID-19 cases with the employee's
               name, contact information, occupation, location where the employee worked, the date
               of the last day at the workplace, and the date of a positive COVID-19 test. The
               information must be made available to employees, authorized employee representatives,
               or as otherwise required by law, with personal identifying information removed. </span></li>

            Cases:</span></p>
<p class="p" id="rbv1672211781056__ID-00002868">Employers must:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Ensure that COVID-19 cases are excluded from the workplace until
               the return to work requirements are met (see next section). </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Exclude employees with COVID-19 exposure from the workplace for 14
               days after the last known COVID-19 exposure to a COVID-19 case. <span class="ph strong">Update:</span> On December 14, 2020, California's governor

                           Quarantine Guidelines</a>; or</span></span></li>

                  <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Any applicable quarantine or
                        isolation period recommended or ordered by a local health officer who has
                        jurisdiction over the workplace.</span></span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">For employees excluded from work under these rules and otherwise
            able and available to work, employers must continue and maintain an employee's earnings,
            seniority, and all other employee rights and benefits as if the employee had not been
            removed from their job. Employers may use employer-provided employee sick leave benefits
            for this purpose and consider benefit payments from public sources in determining how to
            maintain earnings, rights and benefits, where permitted by law and when not covered by
            workers' compensation. However, these requirements don't apply:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">To any period of time during which the employee is unable to work
               for reasons other than protecting persons at the workplace from possible COVID-19
               transmission. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Where the employer demonstrates that the COVID-19 exposure isn't
               work related. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">At the time of exclusion, the employer must provide the employee
            information regarding COVID-19-related benefits to which the employee may be entitled
            under applicable federal, state, or local laws. Employers must also inform employees of
            the rights and benefits extended to employees excluded from work under the rules and
            otherwise able and available to work.</p>
<p class="p">Employees who haven't been
            excluded or isolated by the local health department need not be excluded by the
            employer, if they are temporarily reassigned to work where they don't have contact with
            other persons until the return to work requirements are met.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">11. Return to Work Criteria:</span></p>
<p class="p">COVID-19 cases with COVID-19 symptoms are prohibited from returning to work until:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">At least 24 hours have passed since a fever of 100.4 or higher has
               resolved without the use of fever-reducing medications; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">COVID-19 symptoms have improved; <span class="ph em">and</span></span></li>

            <li><span class="li">At least 10 days have passed since COVID-19 symptoms first
               appeared. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">COVID-19 cases who tested positive but never developed COVID-19
            symptoms are prohibited from returning to work until a minimum of 10 days have passed
            since the date of specimen collection of their first positive COVID-19 test. The rules
            prohibit requiring a negative COVID-19 test for an employee to return to work.</p>
<p class="p">If an order to isolate or quarantine an employee is issued by a local
            or state health official, the employee is prohibited from returning to work until the
            period of isolation or quarantine is completed or the order is lifted. If no period was
            specified, then the period is 10 days from the time the order to isolate was effective,
            or 14 days from the time the order to quarantine was effective (see <a class="xref" href="rbv1672211781056.html#rbv1672211781056__ID-00002868" target="help_frame">Update</a> above).</p>
<p class="p">If there are no violations of local or state health officer orders for
            isolation or quarantine, the DIR may, upon request, allow employees to return to work on
            the basis that the removal of an employee would create undue risk to a community's
            health and safety. In such cases, the employer must develop, implement, and maintain
            effective control measures to prevent transmission in the workplace including providing
            isolation for the employee at the workplace and, if isolation isn't possible, the use of
            respiratory protection in the workplace.</p>
