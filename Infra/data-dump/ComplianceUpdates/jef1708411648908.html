      <p class="p">The U.S. Department of Labor has released industry-specific guidance on expanded protections for nursing employees under federal law.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jef1708411648908__section_upd_twp_m1c"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p subHeading1">Background</p>

         <p class="p">Effective December 29, 2022, the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections for Nursing
            Mothers Act amended Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to entitle more employees to
            reasonable break time to express breast milk for their nursing child.</p>

         <p class="p">As a result, employers must provide reasonable break time to both exempt and nonexempt
            employees, so they can express breast milk for their nursing child for one year after
            the child's birth. The employee is entitled to reasonable break time each time they have
            a need to express the milk.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers are also required to provide a place, other than a bathroom, that is shielded
            from view and free from intrusion from co-workers and the public, which may be used by
            an employee to express breast milk.</p>

         <p class="p">The break time may be unpaid unless otherwise required to be paid by federal, state or
            municipal law, provided the employee is completely relieved from duty during the
            entirety of the break.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="jef1708411648908__note_vwc_zwp_m1c"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>With limited exceptions, federal law requires employers to pay exempt employees their
               full salary in any workweek in which they perform any work, regardless of the
               quantity or quality of the work. As such, deductions from any exempt employees'
               salary for such breaks are prohibited.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p">As was the case prior to the amendment, employers with fewer than 50 employees are
            exempt from the requirements if the requirements would impose an undue hardship by
            causing the employer significant difficulty or expense when considered in relation to
            the size, financial resources, nature, or structure of the employer's business.
            Crewmembers of air carriers are also exempt from the law. There are also special rules
            for rail carriers.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Industry-Specific Guidance</p>

         <p class="p">The U.S. Department of Labor has begun releasing industry-specific guidance on the
            expanded law, covering the agriculture, retail and restaurant, healthcare, education,
            and transportation industries. The guidance consists of a prerecorded presentation and
            answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs).</p>

         <p class="p">For example, the FAQs for the <a class="xref" href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pump-at-work" target="_blank">retail and
               restaurant industries include answers</a> to the following inquiries.</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="jef1708411648908__ul_s4v_twp_m1c">
            <li><span class="li">Can employers require employees to make up time that nursing employees spend on pump
               breaks in order to meet productivity measures?</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"> No. Employers cannot hold the time that employees take for pump breaks against them
               when determining whether they met a productivity measure or quota. Employees also
               cannot be required to make up the time they took for pump breaks. An employer adding
               work time to an employee's normal schedule could be considered prohibited retaliation
               under the FLSA.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">I work for a fast-food restaurant that has locations in many different states. If my
               employer follows federal law, do they also have to follow different state laws that
               require accommodations for nursing employees?</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"> Yes. Many states have laws related to pumping milk at work. Employees may have
               greater protections under such state or local laws or ordinances. The FLSA provides
               that the reasonable break time and space requirements do not preclude greater
               employee protections provided under these laws.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"> For example, some states may require that all breaks for pumping be paid or may
               require that breaks be made available for more than one year. Employers must follow
               all the laws that apply to them.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">I work in a bookstore that has three bathrooms. One of the bathrooms is designated
               as a family bathroom. It has one stall and a changing table. My supervisor put an out
               of order sign on the stall door and placed a chair in the family bathroom for me to
               take pump breaks. Can I be required to use the bathroom to pump breast milk if it is
               not being used as a bathroom?</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"> No. The FLSA requires that nursing employees have access to a place to pump breast
               milk at work that is not a bathroom. Using a bathroom to pump breast milk raises
               health and safety concerns, which may include the risk of contracting bacteria in
               breast milk or breast pump equipment. </span></li>
