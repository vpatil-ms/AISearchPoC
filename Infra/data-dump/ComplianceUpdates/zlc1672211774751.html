      <p class="p">The Virginia Safety and Health Codes Board enacted a temporary workplace safety standard in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Emergency Temporary Standard is effective July 27, 2020.</p>

      <p class="p">Below is an overview of the standard. To read the standard in full, <a class="xref" href="https://www.doli.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/COVID-19-Emergency-Temporary-Standard-FOR-PUBLIC-DISTRIBUTION-FINAL-7.17.2020.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="zlc1672211774751__section_N10053_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Assessment and Classification:</h2><p class="p">Employers must conduct an assessment of the workplace for hazards and job tasks that potentially expose employees to COVID-19. Employers must also classify each job task according to the risk of exposure.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="zlc1672211774751__section_N1005D_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Self-Monitoring:</h2><p class="p">Employers must notify employees of the methods of exposure and transmission of COVID-19 and encourage employees to self-monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 if they suspect possible exposure or are experiencing signs of an oncoming illness.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="zlc1672211774751__section_N10067_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Notification Requirements:</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employee Notification:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers must develop and implement policies and procedures for employees to report when they are experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employer Notification:</span></p>
<p class="p">Generally, if an employer receives a report of an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19, the employer has 24 hours to notify individuals who may have been exposed, the building or facility owner, and the Virginia Department of Health. When notifying the building or facility owner and other individuals, employers must keep the identity of the infected person confidential. Employers must also notify the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry (DOLI) within 24 hours of the discovery of three or more employees within a 14-day period testing positive for COVID-19.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="zlc1672211774751__section_N1007A_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Return to Work (Infected Employees):</h2><p class="p">Employers must develop and implement policies and procedures for employees with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 and may not permit employees known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 to report to, or remain at, the work site until they're cleared to return to work (using a symptom- or test-based strategy). A symptom-based approach excludes employees from the workplace until at least three days have passed since recovery and at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared. A testing approach excludes infected employees until they have a negative COVID-19 test result. If an employer elects to require employees to test negative for COVID-19 before returning to work, the employer must pay for the tests.</p>
<p class="p">Employers are not permitted to use anti-body testing when making return to work decisions.</p>

      <section class="section" id="zlc1672211774751__section_N10087_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Workplace Controls:</h2>
         
         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Social Distancing:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must ensure that employees observe physical distancing at all
            times and leverage verbal announcements, signage, or visual cues to promote physical
            distancing. Access to common areas, breakrooms, or lunchrooms must be closed or
            controlled.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Sanitation and Disinfecting:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employees that interact with customers or other persons, must be
            provided with and immediately use supplies to clean and disinfect surfaces contacted
            during the interaction.</p>

         <p class="p">All common spaces, including bathrooms, frequently touched surfaces and
            doors must, at a minimum, be cleaned and disinfected at the end of each shift. All
            shared tools, equipment, workspaces, and vehicles must be cleaned and disinfected prior
            to transfer from one employee to another. Employers must ensure that cleaning and
            disinfecting products are readily available to employees.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):</span></p>

         <p class="p">When engineering, work practice, and administrative controls are not
            feasible or do not provide sufficient protection, employers must provide PPE to their
            employees and ensure its proper use in accordance with VOSH laws, standards, and
            regulations. Employers must also ensure compliance with respiratory protection when the
            nature of an employee's work or work area doesn't allow physical distancing. When
            multiple employees are occupying a vehicle for work purposes, the employer must ensure
            compliance with respiratory protection and PPE standards applicable to its industry.</p>

      <section class="section" id="zlc1672211774751__section_N100A3_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Very High and High Risk of Exposure:</h2><p class="p">The following requirements for employers with hazards or job tasks classified as <span class="q">“very high”</span> or <span class="q">“high”</span> exposure risk also apply:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">To the extent feasible, employers must install physical barriers, such as clear plastic sneeze guards, where such barriers will aid in mitigating the spread of virus transmission.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prior to the start of each shift, prescreen or survey each covered employee to ensure they do not have signs or symptoms of COVID-19.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Limit non-employee access to the workplace or restrict access to only certain areas to reduce the risk of exposure.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Where feasible, postpone non-essential travel and implement telework, staggered shifts, phone and video conferencing, and curbside pickup.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Develop an <span class="ph strong">infectious disease preparedness
                  and response plan</span> (this requirement also applies to employers with hazards or
               job tasks classified as <span class="q">“medium”</span> if the employer has 11 or more
               employees) by August 26, 2020. The plan must address the level(s) of risk associated
               with the hazards employees are exposed to, and the engineering, administrative, and
               PPE controls necessary to address those risks. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Examples of high and very high risks tasks include healthcare and mortuary services. Medium risk job tasks involve certain specialty work, like meat processing and commercial transportation, as well as tasks that involve frequent interaction with the public, like stores and restaurants. Traditional office work tasks are classified as lower risk.</p>

Employers must prepare and maintain a written certification of training completed for each employee. Lower risk employers do not have to provide formal training but must distribute information to employees about hazards and characteristics of COVID-19.</p>
