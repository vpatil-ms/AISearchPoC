      <p class="p">New Hampshire has enacted legislation, which creates a voluntary Family and Medical Leave Insurance wage replacement program for employers. To participate in the Paid Family and Medical Leave (NH PFML) Insurance Plan, employers can contract with the state's selected provider (MetLife) or their own provider. Eligible employees may purchase NH PFML for themselves if their employers do not provide NH PFML insurance or an equivalent benefit.</p>

      <section class="section" id="zui1679044757991__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Covered Employees and Enrollment:</span></p>
<p class="p">All employees working in New Hampshire for an employer with a physical presence in NH are eligible for NH PFML benefits.</p>
<p class="p"> If employers choose to fund the benefit on behalf of employees, open enrollment is not needed. All employees can be informed of the new benefit and how to file when needed. If employers are passing on some or all of the premium payments to the workforce, then open enrollment is required. Employees are not required to participate in NH PFML's program.</p>
<p class="p"> If an employee opts out of the employer plan, they cannot purchase insurance as an individual. New employees will have the ability to enroll within 30 days of their hire date and annual enrollment will allow employees the opportunity to join each year. Terminated employees will have the ability to purchase insurance as individuals if their new employer does not sponsor a NH PFML plan.</p>
<p class="p"> Eligible employees may purchase NH PFML for themselves if their employers do not provide NH PFML insurance or an equivalent benefit.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong"><span class="ph strong">Enrollment
                  Period:</span></span></p>

         <p class="p">To participate in the NH PFML Insurance Plan, employers can contract with MetLife or
            their selected provider. The 60-day enrollment period for employers is scheduled to
            begin on December 1, 2022, and will begin for individuals on January 1, 2023.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Reasons for Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Leave can be taken for several reasons, including:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="zui1679044757991__ul_tsr_gbl_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">The birth of the employee's child or a child's placement with the employee for
               adoption or fostering. Either must occur within the past 12 months; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A qualifying exigency that arises from foreign deployment with the armed forces or
               to care for a service member with a serious injury or illness covered under the
               federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA); </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A family member's serious health condition, including illnesses covered by the FMLA,
               such as the treatment for an addiction or a mental health condition; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee's serious health condition, unrelated to employment, when</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"> their employer does not offer Short Term Disability insurance. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Benefit Amount and Taxes:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The NH PFML Insurance Plan includes: </p>

         <ul class="ul" id="zui1679044757991__ul_ncl_3bl_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Paid Family and Paid Medical Leave together in a single insurance policy </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">60% wage replacement benefits up to the Social Security wage cap for qualifying
               leave reasons </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Leave can be taken all at once (continuous) or in partial days (intermittent) with a
               minimum of 4-hour increments </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers have the choice of duration to offer under their NH PFML Insurance Plan:
                  <ul class="ul" id="zui1679044757991__ul_ocl_3bl_wwb">
                  <li><span class="li">Option 1: 6 paid weeks of leave </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Option 2: 12 paid weeks of leave (Note that this option is not available for
                     individual employee plans) </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">For paid family leave, taxes are not automatically withheld from benefits, but employees
            can request voluntary tax withholding. Employees need to submit a W-4S tax form to the
            MetLife claims team and taxes can be withheld. Paid medical leaves are treated like
            disability income and taxes are automatically withheld from benefits.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Costs and Tax Credits:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers will have the ability to work directly with MetLife to customize a plan and
            premium to meet their business needs within regulatory parameters set by the state.</p>

         <p class="p">The NH PFML plan incentivizes employers to purchase six weeks of coverage by providing a
            Business Enterprise Tax (BET) Credit equal to 50% of the premium they pay. Employers
            will need to complete and submit the most recent Schedule of Business Profits Tax (BPT)
            Credit (form DP-160) to the NH Department of Revenue administration to claim the NH
            business tax credit.</p>

         <p class="p">An employer may fully fund the premium cost on their 'employees' behalf, split the
            premium cost with employees or pass on the full cost to employees (in which case no BET
            credit would be available).</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employer Purchase Options:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers are not required to purchase a plan through MetLife. New Hampshire Department
            of Insurance regulations allow other insurance companies to seek approval to provide
            paid family and medical leave benefit plans. However, employers who purchase other paid
            family and medical leave insurance plans or employer equivalent coverage will not
            qualify for the BET Tax Credit.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers can choose to provide:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="zui1679044757991__ul_nqv_lbl_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">The plan issued by MetLife, the ' 'state's insurance partner, and receive the 50%
               BET Credit; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Other paid family and medical leave insurance plans approved by the New Hampshire
               Department of Insurance; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Self-insured employer equivalent benefit coverage. See the <a class="xref" href="https://www.paidfamilymedicalleave.nh.gov/employers/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">FAQs</a> issued by the state for more information on what is
               considered an equivalent plan.</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employer Requirements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employer requirements differ based on employer size.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">All Employers:</span></p>

         <ul class="ul" id="zui1679044757991__ul_i31_4bl_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Must provide wage and leave information, work schedule and other benefit information
               to MetLife. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Are prohibited from discriminating or retaliating against employees for taking
               leave. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">As a reminder, under current law, employers are required to provide employees a
            statement of deductions each pay period.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employers with 50 or more Employees
            must:</span></p>

         <ul class="ul" id="zui1679044757991__ul_xpd_qbl_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Collect premium payments through payroll deduction. This requirement applies whether
               the employer opts into the NH PFML insurance plan or if employees purchase coverage
               under a NH PFML individual plan. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Restore employees to the position they held prior to leave or to an equivalent
               position. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Continue to provide health insurance during leave, with employees paying any shared
               costs. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employers with Fewer Than 50 Employees
               can:</span></p>

         <ul class="ul" id="zui1679044757991__ul_bhs_rbl_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Collect premium payments through payroll deductions, but are not required to do so. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Make premium payments through arrangements with MetLife. </span></li>

         </ul>
