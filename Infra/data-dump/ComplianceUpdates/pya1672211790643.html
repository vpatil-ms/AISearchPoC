      <p class="p">The Chicago City Council has approved an ordinance (Ordinance No.
         O2021-2182) that will amend and expand the city's paid sick leave law. The changes take
         effect <span class="ph strong">August 1, 2021</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="pya1672211790643__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">Chicago requires all employers with at least one covered employee to provide paid sick leave. To be considered a covered employee, the employee must:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Work within the city for at least two hours in any two-week period; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Work at least 80 hours for an employer within any 120-day period. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Covered employees generally are entitled to accrue at least one hour of leave for every 40 hours of work. Employers may cap accrual at 40 hours per 12-month period.</p>
<p class="p">Under existing law, covered employees may use paid sick leave in the following circumstances.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employee, or a family member, is ill or injured, or for the purpose of receiving medical care, treatment, diagnosis, or preventive medical care. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee, or a family member, is the victim of domestic violence or a sex offense; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee's place of business is closed by order of a public official due to a public health emergency. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee needs to care for a child whose school or place of care has been closed by order of a public official due to a public health emergency. </span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="pya1672211790643__section_xbx_kzz_wxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Existing Notice and Poster Requirements</h2>
         
         <p class="p"> Existing law also requires employers to post a notice advising employees of their
            rights under the ordinance The notice must also be provided to covered employees with
            their first paycheck and then each year with a paycheck issued within 30 days of July
            1.</p>

         <p class="p"> Employers must post the notice through their usual communication methods for such
            notices, whether by paper or electronically. When posting a paper notice, the notice
            must be printed on and scaled to fill a sheet of paper that measures eleven inches by
            seventeen inches.</p>

         <p class="p"> Similarly, the notice employers provide with the first paycheck must also be printed on
            and scaled to fit a sheet of paper that measures eight and a half inches by eleven
            inches. However, where covered employees are enrolled in direct deposit and do not
            receive a <span class="q">“paycheck”</span> but have the option to review their pay stubs electronically,
            employers may provide the notice to covered employees through the employers' usual
            methods of electronic communication.</p>

         <p class="p"> All notices must be posted in English and any language(s) spoken by employees at the
            facility who are not proficient in English and in which the Department has provided
            non-English language notices.</p>

            the law would be liable for unpaid wages as well as damages. In the required notice that
            employers are required to post and provide to employees, information on the ability to
            seek redress for wage theft must be included.</p>
