      <p class="p">Colorado has enacted legislation (House Bill 22-1112) that amends the rules governing when an employee must give notice to their employer of a workplace injury and makes changes to the notice that employers are required to display. House Bill 22-1112 is expected to take effect on or about August 9, 2022.</p>

      <section class="section" id="gep1672211802082__section_N1004C_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employee Notice:</h2><p class="p">Under House Bill 22-1112, an employee who sustains an injury resulting from a workplace accident must notify their employer in writing within ten days. Prior to House Bill 22-1112, an employee only had four days to report the injury to their employer. As is the case under existing rules, if the employee fails to report the injury in writing by the deadline, they may lose a day of workers' compensation benefits for each day they fail to report.</p>
<p class="p">An employer that receives such notice must affix the date and time of receipt on the notice and make a copy of it (with the date and time of receipt) available to the employee within seven days.</p>

      <section class="section" id="gep1672211802082__section_N10059_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employer Notice:</h2><p class="p">As is the case under existing rules, employers must display in the workplace a printed card that is at least 14 inches high and 11 inches wide about workers' compensation. Each letter of the text on the card must be at least 0.5 inches high. House Bill 22-1112 makes changes to the contents of this required notice. When the law takes effect, the printed card must contain the following language:</p>
<p class="p">NOTICE IF YOU ARE INJURED ON THE JOB</p>
<p class="p">YOU HAVE RIGHTS UNDER THE COLORADO WORKERS' COMPENSATION ACT. YOUR EMPLOYER IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO HAVE WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE. THE COST OF THE INSURANCE IS PAID ENTIRELY BY YOUR EMPLOYER. IF YOUR EMPLOYER DOES NOT HAVE WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE, YOU STILL HAVE RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW. IT IS AGAINST THE LAW FOR YOUR EMPLOYER TO HAVE A POLICY CONTRARY TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THE COLORADO WORKERS' COMPENSATION ACT. YOUR EMPLOYER IS INSURED THROUGH _________________________________________________________________________________________________. IF YOU ARE INJURED ON THE JOB, NOTIFY YOUR EMPLOYER AS SOON AS YOU ARE ABLE, AND REPORT YOUR INJURY TO YOUR EMPLOYER IN WRITING WITHIN 10 DAYS AFTER THE INJURY. IF YOU DO NOT REPORT YOUR INJURY PROMPTLY, YOU MAY STILL PURSUE A CLAIM. ADVISE YOUR EMPLOYER IF YOU NEED MEDICAL TREATMENT. IF YOU OBTAIN MEDICAL CARE, BE SURE TO REPORT TO YOUR EMPLOYER AND HEALTH-CARE PROVIDER HOW, WHEN, AND WHERE THE INJURY OCCURRED. YOU MAY FILE A WORKER'S CLAIM FOR COMPENSATION WITH THE DIVISION OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION. TO OBTAIN FORMS OR INFORMATION REGARDING THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION SYSTEM, THE</p>
<p class="p">CUSTOMER SERVICE CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE DIVISION OF WORKERS'</p>
<p class="p">COMPENSATION IS _________________________________________________________________________________________________.</p>
<p class="p">If, at the time of injury, the employer failed to display this notice, the timeframe for the employee to report the injury won't start until the employer complies with the requirement.</p>
