            <li><span class="li">Keep records demonstrating compliance for at least two years; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide written copies upon request of all original or modified schedules for every employee at that location for any previous week over the last two years; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Post written schedule notices which contain the days, times, and shifts employees should and should not expect to work or be on-call, as well as the methods the employer uses when assigning shifts. This information must be posted in an accessible, customary, and conspicuous location. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Scheduling:</span></p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">When developing work schedules, consider employee preferences, including undesired locations and times; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Allow employees nine hours of rest time between shifts; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Allow employees to decline rest time without penalty; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">For any rest time worked, collect a written statement of consent from employees and pay the employee $40 for each rest-time shift worked; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide employees with a written schedule at least 14 days in advance. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Schedule Changes:</span></p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Notify employees of a schedule change as soon as possible prior to the change; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Write and post all amended schedules within 24 hours of the change; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Allow employees to accept or refuse any hours or shifts that aren't posted. </span></li>

<div class="note note" id="bzj1672211785601__note_N100B5_N10063_N10041_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employees must provide their written consent to work unposted hours.</p>
</div>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Predictability Pay:</span></p>
<p class="p">When an employer changes a posted schedule with less than 14 days' notice (including extending a shift or changing the date, time or location of a shift without loss of hours), they must pay affected employees one hour of predictability pay at an employee's regular rate of pay. If an employee cannot work because their employer cancels a regular or on-call shift or reduces their regular hours, the employer must be paid a half-hour of predictability pay at the employee's regular rate of pay.</p>
<p class="p">Covered employers do not have to pay predictability pay when an employee requests a schedule change in writing or for an employee who starts or ends work less than 20 minutes before or after their scheduled start and end times.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">New Hire Scheduling:</span></p>
<p class="p">On or before an employee's start date, employers must provide new hires with a written schedule of the average number of hours the employer expects them to work over a 90-day period. The schedule should align with the currently posted schedule, state any on-call shifts, and include days, times, and shifts an employee should and should not expect to work.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Assigning Open Shifts:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers must offer shifts to qualified, current employees at that location before new employees are hired for that shift. Employers that require employees at other locations to be considered before offering new hire's the shift must maintain that practice.</p>
<p class="p">Employers may fill an open shift with an external hire if:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">They provide written notice at least 72 hours in advance of the available shift (unless the open shift is required to be filled sooner), and no qualified employee accepts the open shift within 24 hours following the 72 hour notice period; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Failing to hire the external employee would force an employer to pay overtime to an employee at another location to cover the work. </span></li>
