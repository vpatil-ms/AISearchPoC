Ordinance 200306 amends the city's paid sick and safe time law (also known as the Promoting Healthy Families and Workplaces Ordinance (PHFWO)). Ordinance 200303 requires new public health emergency leave (PHEL) for workers who do not receive leave under the federal <a class="xref" href="https://sbshrs.adpinfo.com/covid19-stimulus-package" target="_blank">Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)</a>.</p>

<p class="p">Ordinance 200306 requires certain healthcare employees who contract a disease during a declared pandemic or epidemic to receive compensation and medical care or reimbursement. Ordinance 200306 is effective immediately.</p>

<p class="p">Ordinance 200303 requires PHEL for employees, gig workers, and others who are not entitled to leave under the federal FFCRA. Under the law, a public health emergency (PHE) is an emergency related to a public health threat or risk in Philadelphia and is declared by a federal, state, or local official.</p>

<p class="p">If a federal or state law requires a hiring entity to provide paid leave or paid sick time related to a PHE, the hiring entity may require PHEL to run concurrently with such leave unless another law prohibits concurrent use. Hiring entities must also provide additional PHEL if Philadelphia law's requirements exceed the requirements of other laws.</p>
