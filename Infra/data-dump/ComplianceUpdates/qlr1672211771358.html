      <p class="p">Effective immediately, Seattle has expanded the reasons employees may take leave under its Paid Sick and Safe Time (PSST) Ordinance.</p>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">Under Seattle's paid sick leave ordinance, an employee may take leave to care for themselves or a family member due to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A physical or mental health condition, including a doctor's appointment; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Their child's place of care or school was closed due to the order of a public health official for a health-related reason; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When a public official ordered their place of business to close. </span></li>

         </ul>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Amendments:</h2><p class="p">The City Council amended the ordinance to allow employees to take leave when any family member's (not just their child's) school or place of care has been closed for any reason. For employers with 250 or more full-time equivalent employees, employees can also take leave when their place of business has been closed for any health or safety reason.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">Seattle employers should review their policies, forms, practices, and supervisor training to ensure compliance with the Ordinance as amended.</p>
