      <p class="p">The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled 9-0 that, when establishing an undue hardship in the context of providing reasonable accommodations for employees' religious beliefs and practices, employers must demonstrate substantial increased costs in relation to the operations of its particular business.</p>

      <p class="p">Prior to the ruling, an employer was typically only required to demonstrate, when showing undue hardship, that the religious accommodation would require more than de minimis (minimal) cost to be exempt from the requirement under federal law.</p>

      <section class="section" id="dhj1689750195410__section_fwq_hwq_fyb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">In the case before the U.S. Supreme Court, a United States Postal Service (USPS) worker
            refused to work Sundays for religious reasons. However, the employee continued to be
            scheduled on Sundays and was subject to discipline when he failed to work such shifts.
            The employee eventually resigned.</p>

         <p class="p">Under federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act requires employers with 15 or more
            employees to provide reasonable accommodations for employees' sincerely held religious
            beliefs or practices, unless it would cause an undue hardship.</p>

         <p class="p">Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling, undue hardship for the purposes of religious
            accommodations was typically defined by courts as more than de minimis cost (costs so
            very small or trifling that that they aren't even worth noticing ).</p>

         <p class="p">However, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the use of the de minimis standard was
            incorrect. Instead, undue hardship must be defined as substantial increased costs in
            relation to the operations of the particular business, the court ruled.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="q">“What matters more than a favored synonym for 'undue hardship' (which is the actual
               text) is that courts must apply the test in a manner that takes into account all
               relevant factors in the case at hand, including the particular accommodations at
               issue and their practical impact in light of the nature, 'size and operating cost of
               [an] employer,'”</span> the court wrote.</p>

         <p class="p">The court also ruled that the impacts of accommodations on co-workers are relevant only
            to the extent those impacts go on to affect the conduct of the business. For example, a
            hardship that is attributable to employee animosity to a particular religion, to
            religion in general, or to the very notion of accommodating religious practice, cannot
            be considered <span class="q">“undue.”</span></p>

         <p class="p">Further, the court ruled that Title VII requires that an employer <span class="q">“reasonably
               accommodate”</span> an employee's practice of religion, not merely assess the
            reasonableness of a particular possible accommodation or accommodations. Faced with an
            accommodation request like the USPS worker's, an employer must do more than conclude
            that forcing other employees to work overtime would constitute an undue hardship.
            Consideration of other options, such as voluntary shift swapping, would also be
            necessary.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers should review their policies and practices to ensure they conform with the
            U.S. Supreme Court's decision. As always, employers should work with legal counsel when
            determining whether an undue hardship exists.</p>
