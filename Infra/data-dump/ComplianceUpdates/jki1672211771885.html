         <p class="p">Employers must use the calendar year to determine their number of
            employees. However, employers may choose to set a different consecutive 12-month period
            for purposes of leave accrual and use.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Pay:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must compensate employees at their regular rates of pay, or
            the applicable minimum wage, whichever is greater.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Accrual:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employees must accrue at least one hour of sick time for every 30 hours
            worked starting on September 30, 2020. Employers must permit employees to begin using
            leave on <span class="ph strong">January 1, 2021</span>.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers may frontload all available leave at the start of the calendar
            year.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Use and carryover:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers can set a reasonable minimum increment for sick time use,
            which cannot exceed four hours.</p>

         <p class="p">Employees may carry over unused sick time into the following calendar
            year, however, employers with fewer than 100 employees may limit the use of sick leave
            to 40 hours per calendar year. Employers with 100 or more employees can limit use to 56
            hours per calendar year.</p>

         <p class="p">The law does not require employers to pay an employee for unused sick
            time at the time of termination, regardless of the reason.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Reasons for leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employees may take sick leave for the following reasons:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">For the employee's, or their family member's, mental or physical
               illness, injury, or health condition, regardless of whether or not such conditions
               are diagnosed or require medical care at the time of the request. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">For the employee's, or their family member's, diagnosis, care, or
               treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition, including
               preventative care. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When the employee or their family member is a victim of domestic
               violence, a family offense, sexual offense, stalking, or human trafficking. Leave may
               be used to obtain services, participate in safety planning, relocate, meet with an
               attorney or social services provider, participate in civil or criminal proceedings,
               file a complaint with law enforcement, enroll their child in a new school, or take
               any other action to ensure their health and safety. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Family members include an employee's:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Child (adopted, biological, or foster child, a legal ward, or a
               child of an employee standing in the place of a parent) </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Spouse or domestic partner and parent or child of an employee's
               spouse or domestic partner </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Parent (biological, foster, step or adoptive parent, or legal
               guardian of an employee, or a person who stood in place of a parent when the employee
               was a minor child) </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Sibling </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Grandchild or grandparent </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Recordkeeping:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must maintain records showing the amount of sick leave
            provided to each employee for a period of at least six years.</p>

         <p class="p">Further, employers must provide employees with a summary of the amounts
            of sick leave earned and used in both the current calendar year and any previous
            calendar year(s) within 3 business days of an employee's verbal or written request.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Anti-retaliation:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers may not retaliate against employees for using or requesting
            sick leave. Employers are also prohibited from requiring, as a condition of providing
            sick leave, the disclosure of an employee's, or their family member's, confidential
            medical information.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Job reinstatement:</span></p>

         <p class="p">After using sick leave, the employee must be restored to their previous
            position with the same pay and other terms and conditions of employment.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Interaction with existing PTO programs and
               local ordinances:</span></p>

         <p class="p">An employer will not be required to provide additional leave if it has
            an existing sick leave or time off policy that provides employees with leave that meets
            or exceeds the accrual, carryover, and use requirements of Senate Bill 7506B.</p>

         <p class="p">Additionally, cities with populations of 1 million or more are permitted
            to enact their own local laws that meet or exceed the minimum requirements of Senate
            Bill 7506B. Any paid sick program enforced by a local jurisdiction in effect as of
            January 1, 2021 will be enforceable. Employers in such jurisdictions will need to
            coordinate compliance with both laws.</p>
