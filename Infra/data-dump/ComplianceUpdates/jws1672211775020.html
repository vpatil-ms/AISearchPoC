      <p class="p">Oakland is one of several California cities that have expanded the requirements for providing emergency paid sick leave. Oakland's ordinance went into effect on May 12, 2020 and expires on December 31, 2020.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jws1672211775020__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Coverage:</h2><p class="p">The city's ordinance applies to all employers with 50 or more employees between February 3, 2020 and March 4, 2020. It also applies to unregistered janitorial employers of any size, and franchises with fewer than 50 employees associated with a franchisor or network of franchises employing more than 500 employees in total.</p>
<p class="p">Employers that allow employees to accrue at least 160 hours of paid leave hours (such as personal, sick, vacation) and allow employees immediate access to at least 80 hours of paid leave after May 12, 2020 for the uses allowed under the ordinance are exempt from the requirement to provide emergency paid sick leave, but are subject to the remainder of the ordinance.</p>

Other employees must be provided with leave equal to the average number of hours the employee worked in the city over the 14 days with the highest number of hours worked from February 3, 2020 and March 4, 2020.</p>
<p class="p">An employer may credit the total sick leave hours provided under the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) against their obligations under the ordinance.</p>
