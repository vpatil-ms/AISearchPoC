      <p class="p">Oregon has enacted legislation (House Bill 4138), which impacts temporary
         disability benefit payments under the state's Workers Compensation (WC) system. The changes
         would apply to all claims that exist on, or arise on or after, <span class="ph strong">January 1, 2024</span>, regardless of the date of injury or the date the claim is filed
         as long as a final determination on the claim has not been made prior to January 1,
         2024.</p>

      <section class="section" id="pgj1679044758477__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Currently, temporary disability benefits under ORS 656.262 may be
            suspended under any of the following conditions:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="pgj1679044758477__ul_ezj_3ml_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">A worker fails to appear at an appointment with their practitioner
               and subsequently fails to appear at the rescheduled appointment; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An insurer fails to receive verification of the worker's inability to
               work from the worker's practitioner; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The period of time authorized by the practitioner for the worker to
               receive temporary disability benefits has expired; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A worker enrolled in a managed care organization seeks unauthorized
               care. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Additionally, under current law, reinstated temporary disability
            benefits following a suspension may be paid retroactively no more than 14 days prior to
            authorization by the worker's attending physician or nurse practitioner.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Summary of Changes:</span></p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Changes to Payments of Temporary Disability
               Benefits:</span></p>

         <p class="p">House Bill 4138 as enacted, replaces the current 14- day limit with a
            period for retroactively authorized payments of no more than 45 days prior to the worker
            receiving written notice of suspension of temporary disability compensation.</p>

         <p class="p">However, it is important to note that the 45-day limit does not
            apply:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="pgj1679044758477__ul_prt_fml_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">During periods in which there is a denial under the jurisdiction of
               the Workers' Compensation Board that affects the worker's ability to obtain
               authorization of temporary disability;</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">During periods in which there is a dispute over the identity of, or
               treatment by, an attending physician or nurse practitioner that affects the worker's
               ability to obtain authorization of temporary disability; or</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When notice has not been given as required.</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Changes to Notice to Workers:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The newly enacted legislation requires that the carrier, or employer
            when self-insured, send a written notice to the worker, and their attorney if they are
            represented, that temporary disability benefits will be ended, along with the reason for
            the benefits ending.</p>

         <p class="p">Also, House Bill 4138 stipulates that the worker's attending physician
            or nurse practitioner may retroactively authorize disability benefits for up to 45 days
            prior to the date of the notice.</p>

         <p class="p">Additionally, if the required notice is provided more than 45 days after
            the worker was no longer eligible for benefits, the attending physician or nurse
            practitioner may retroactively authorize temporary disability back to the date on which
            benefits were no longer due and payable, provided the authorization is made within 30
            days following the earlier of the date of mailing or delivery of the written notice that
            the eligibility ended.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Closing Claims Based on Medical
            Status:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Under current law, the carrier of a self-insured employer may close a
            worker's claim and determine the extent of the worker's permanent disability when the
            worker has become <span class="q">“medically stationary”</span> and there is sufficient
            information to determine permanent disability. Medically stationary is the point in time
            when the worker's health care provider determines no further significant improvement is
            reasonably expected from medical treatment or the passage of time.</p>

         <p class="p">House Bill 4138 prohibits the worker's health care provider from
            retroactively establishing medically stationary status more than 60 days before the
            worker is notified about their medically stationary status with the exception of worker
            fraud.</p>

         <p class="p">Additionally, an insurer or self-insured employer must mail or deliver
            written notice to a worker and to the worker's attorney, if the worker is represented,
            within seven days following receipt of information that the worker is medically
            stationary,</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Recovery of Overpayment Changes:</span></p>

         <p class="p">House Bill 4138 limits the carrier's or self-insured employer's recovery
            amount in the case of overpayment from a worker's permanent disability compensation to
            50 percent of the claimant's total award except in cases of fraud by the worker.</p>

         <p class="p">Also, an insurer or self-insured employer may not declare an overpayment
            of any compensation that was paid more than two years prior to the date of an
            overpayment declaration.</p>
