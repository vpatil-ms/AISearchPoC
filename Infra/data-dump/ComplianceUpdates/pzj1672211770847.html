      <section class="section" id="pzj1672211770847__section_N10112_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Temporary Guidance for Remote I-9 Document Inspection:</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Covered Employers:</span></p>
<p class="p">The temporary changes apply only to employers and workplaces that are operating
            remotely as a result of COVID-19. If there are employees physically present at a work
            location, <span class="ph em">no exceptions</span> are being implemented at this
            time.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Update:</span> The DHS has released subsequent guidance
            that states that as of April 1, 2021, the requirement that employers inspect employees'
            Form I-9 identity and employment eligibility documentation in-person applies only to
            those employees who physically report to work at a company location on any regular,
            consistent, or predictable basis. If employees hired on or after April 1, 2021 work
            exclusively in a remote setting due to COVID-19-related precautions, they are
            temporarily exempt from the physical inspection requirements until they undertake
            non-remote employment on a regular, consistent, or predictable basis, or the extension
            of the flexibilities related to such requirements is terminated, whichever is
            earlier.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Temporary Changes:</span></p>
<p class="p">The DHS says covered employers with employees taking physical proximity precautions due to COVID-19 will be temporarily exempt from the requirement to review the Section 2 documents in the employee's physical presence. However, employers must inspect the Section 2 documents remotely (such as, over video link, fax or email, etc.) and obtain, inspect, and retain copies of the documents, within three business days for purposes of completing Section 2.</p>
<p class="p">Once normal operations resume, all employees who were onboarded using remote
            verification, must report to their employer within <span class="ph strong">three
               business days</span> for in-person verification of identity and employment eligibility
            documentation for Form I-9. Once acceptable documents have been physically inspected,
            the employer should add <span class="q">“documents physically examined”</span> with the
            date of inspection to the Section 2 additional information field on the Form I-9, or to
            Section 3 as appropriate. Employers should enter <span class="q">“COVID-19”</span> as the
            reason for the physical inspection delay.</p>
<p class="p">Employers that use this option must provide written documentation of their remote onboarding and telework policy for each employee. This burden rests solely with the employer.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Expiration of Exemption:</span></p>
<p class="p">The temporary changes were set to expire May 19, 2020, or within three business days after the termination of the National Emergency, whichever occurs first. However, the DHS has extended them until December 31, 2021.</p>
