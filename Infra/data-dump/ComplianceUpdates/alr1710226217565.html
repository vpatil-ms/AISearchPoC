      <p class="p">Employers with 100 or more employees in Illinois must submit an application to obtain an Equal Pay Registration Certificate (EPRC) from the state by March 23, 2024.</p>

      <section class="section" id="alr1710226217565__section_k4v_3fm_s1c"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">In 2021, the state amended the Illinois Equal Pay Act (IEPA) to require that private
            employers report certain payroll information to the Illinois Department of Labor (IDOL)
            and obtain an EPRC. The requirement applies to any private employer that has 100 or more
            employees in Illinois and is required to file an annual EEO-1 with the U.S. Equal
            Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).</p>

         <p class="p">The IDOL has been assigning each employer a deadline by which it must submit its initial
            application for an EPRC. Employers that haven't received a deadline from the IDOL or
            haven't yet filed their initial application must do so by March 23, 2024. Covered
            employers must also obtain an EPRC every two years after their initial one.</p>

         <p class="p">To obtain an EPRC, covered employers must certify, among other things, that the average
            compensation for their female and certain other employees isn't consistently below the
            average compensation for their counterparts within each of the major job categories in
            the EEO-1, taking into account factors such as length of service, requirements of
            specific jobs, experience, skill, effort, responsibility, working conditions of the job,
            education or training, job location, use of a collective bargaining agreement, or other
            mitigating factors.</p>
