      <p class="p">The New Jersey Department of Labor (NJDOL) has released guidance clarifying the circumstances in which employers may require their employees to receive the COVID-19 vaccination prior to returning to work.</p>

      <section class="section" id="edf1672211784906__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">April 2021 Guidance:</h2><p class="p">The <a class="xref" href="https://www.nj.gov/labor/employer-services/business/covid.shtml" target="_blank">guidance</a> says employers may require
            that their employees receive COVID-19 vaccinations to return to the workplace, except
            under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employee has a disability or a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance that precludes them being vaccinated; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee's physician has advised otherwise due to pregnancy, or need to breastfeed. </span></li>

      <section class="section" id="edf1672211784906__section_N10065_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reasonable Accommodation:</h2><p class="p">An employer must provide a reasonable accommodation from a mandatory vaccine policy for any of the reasons listed above unless doing so would impose an undue burden on their operations.</p>
<p class="p">Employers must consider the safety of themselves, coworkers, clients, and customers when evaluating whether a potential accommodation would be reasonable. They must base all safety decisions regarding any potential safety hazard on objective, scientific evidence and not unfounded assumptions or stereotypes.</p>
<p class="p">Reasonable accommodation may include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Allowing an employee to continue to work remotely or otherwise work in a manner that would reduce or eliminate the risk of harm to other employees or the public; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Providing an employee with personal protective equipment that sufficiently mitigates the employee's risk of COVID-19 transmission and exposure. </span></li>

         </ul>
