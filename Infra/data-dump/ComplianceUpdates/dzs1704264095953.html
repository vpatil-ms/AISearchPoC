      <p class="p">California has enacted legislation that requires employers with 5 or more employees to provide time off to employees who experience a covered reproductive loss event. The requirement takes effect January 1, 2024 and is separate and distinct from the state's bereavement leave and other leave requirements.</p>

      <section class="section" id="dzs1704264095953__section_mgq_yqb_h1c"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p subHeading1">General Requirements</p>

         <p class="p">Under the law, covered employers must grant a request by any covered employee to take up
            to five days of reproductive loss leave following a covered reproductive loss event.</p>

         <p class="p">With one limited exception, the leave must be taken within 3 months of the event.
            However, if the employee is on or chooses to go on a different type of leave to which
            they are entitled under state/federal law, the reproductive loss leave must be completed
            within 3 months of the end of that other leave. Employees are entitled to use the leave
            on consecutive or nonconsecutive days.</p>

         <p class="p">If an employee experiences more reproductive loss events within the 12-month period,
            they are entitled to additional allotments of leave for each instance. However, an
            employer is only required to grant an employee up to 20 days of such leave within a
            12-month period.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Covered Employees</p>

         <p class="p">To be eligible for such leave, an employee must be employed by the employer for at least
            30 days prior to the start of the leave.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Covered Events</p>

         <p class="p">The leave may be taken after a failed adoption, failed surrogacy, miscarriage,
            stillbirth, or an unsuccessful assisted reproduction, provided the employee would have
            been a parent if the covered event were successful. See <a class="xref" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB848" target="_blank">the text of the law</a> for definitions of these events.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Pay During Leave</p>

         <p class="p">The leave must be taken pursuant to any existing applicable leave policy of the
            employer. If there is no existing applicable leave policy, reproductive loss leave may
            be unpaid, except that an employee may use vacation, personal leave, accrued and
            available sick leave, or compensatory time off that is otherwise available to the
            employee.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Documentation</p>

         <p class="p">Nothing in the law requires employees to provide documentation to be entitled to such
            leave.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Retaliation Prohibited</p>

         <p class="p">Employers are prohibited from taking adverse action against an individual because
            they:</p>

            <li><span class="li">Exercise the right to reproductive loss leave. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Give information or testimony as to their own reproductive loss leave, or another
               person's reproductive loss leave, in an inquiry or proceeding related to rights
               guaranteed under the law. </span></li>
