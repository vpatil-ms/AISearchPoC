      <p class="p">Vermont has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 103), which expands protections under the state's current equal pay, nondiscrimination and antiharassment laws and limits certain no-rehire provisions. Senate Bill 103 is effective immediately.</p>

      <section class="section" id="uxm1698731263479__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         <p class="p subHeading1">Pay Protections</p>
<p class="p">Senate Bill 103 amends Vermont's equal pay law, which previously only protected against pay discrimination on the basis of sex. The amended law adds additional protection on the basis of race, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or an employee who is a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="p"> The law does not:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Create new employer rights to ask about an employee's protected characteristic that is otherwise unknown to the employer; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Diminish an employee's right to privacy under any law, applicable contract or collective bargaining agreement. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Rehire Clauses</p>

         <p class="p">The amended law prohibits agreements to settle a claim of employment discrimination from
            including a provision that prevents the employee from working for the employer or an
            affiliate of the employer in the future.</p>

         <p class="p subHeading1">Discrimination and Harassment</p>

         <p class="p">The law also makes it easier to prove that discrimination or harassment occurred. For
            example, under the amended law, except when an employee alleges pay discrimination or
            disparate impact discrimination (e.g., where policies, practices or rules
            disproportionately impact a protected group), an employee is not required to identify
            another employee to whom the employee's treatment can be compared for purposes of
            showing that unlawful discrimination occurred.</p>

         <p class="p">Additionally, the amended law makes clear that harassment does not need to be severe or
            pervasive (a federal law standard) to be considered unlawful under Vermont law.</p>

         <p class="p">Under the law:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="uxm1698731263479__ul_it1_2c3_hzb">
            <li><span class="li">A single incident may constitute unlawful harassment; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Multiple incidents may be considered as harassment, and they will be considered in
               the aggregate with varying types of conduct and conduct based on multiple
               characteristics viewed in totality (rather than in isolation); and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employee's conduct may be unlawful unless a reasonable employee with the same
               protected characteristic would consider the conduct a petty slight or trivial
               inconvenience. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Senate Bill 103 also amends the definition of sexual harassment to be a form of sex
            discrimination and means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other
            verbal or physical, written, auditory, or visual conduct (previously, only verbal or
            physical was listed under the law) of a sexual nature when:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="uxm1698731263479__ul_jt1_2c3_hzb">
            <li><span class="li">Submission to the conduct is made (explicitly or implicitly) a term or condition of
               employment; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An individual's submission to (or rejection of) the conduct negatively impacts
               employment decisions pertaining to the individual; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering (the law previously required
               substantial interference) with an individual's work (previously <span class="q">“work
                  performance”</span>) or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work
               environment. </span></li>

         </ul>
