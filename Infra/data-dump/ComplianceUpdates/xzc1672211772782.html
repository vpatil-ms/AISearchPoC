      <p class="p">Maryland has enacted legislation (House Bill 123 and House Bill 14) that
         expands the state's equal pay protections. Both laws take effect on <span class="ph strong">October 1, 2020</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xzc1672211772782__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">House Bill 123:</h2><p class="p">Under House Bill 123, employers must provide an applicant, upon request, the pay range for the position for which they are applying. Employers may not take adverse action against an applicant for making such a request.</p>
<p class="p">House Bill 123 also prohibits employers from:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Seeking an applicant's pay history. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Relying on an applicant's pay history for screening, selection, and determining pay. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Taking adverse action against an applicant because they didn't provide their pay history. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">An applicant isn't prohibited from voluntarily sharing wage history information. After the employer has made an initial offer of compensation, if an applicant voluntarily shares such information without prompting from the employer, the employer may rely on it, or seek to confirm it, to support a pay offer higher than the initial offer.</p>

<p class="p">Effective October 1, 2020, House Bill 14 also prohibits an employer from taking adverse employment action against an employee for inquiring about their own wages.</p>

Anyone involved with screening or interviewing applicants should also be trained on House Bill 123. Supervisors should also be trained on House Bill 14.</p>
