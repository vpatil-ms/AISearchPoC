      <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Update:</span> A federal judge has granted a
         preliminary injunction blocking the state from enforcing the Florida law discussed
         below.</p>

      <p class="p">Florida has enacted legislation (House Bill 7) that prohibits employers with 15 or more employees from subjecting an individual to training that endorses certain concepts about discrimination. House Bill 7 takes effect July 1, 2022.</p>

      <section class="section" id="yuq1679044749845__section_ydr_xyz_wxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">House Bill 7 establishes that covered employers engage in an unlawful employment
            practice if they subject individuals to training that promotes, advances or compels the
            individual to believe that any of the following concepts constitutes discrimination
            based on race, color, sex or national origin:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="yuq1679044749845__ul_ydk_yyz_wxb">
            <li><span class="li">Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin are morally superior to members
               of another race, color, sex, or national origin. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An individual, by virtue of their race, color, sex, or national origin, is
               inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An individual's moral character or status as either privileged or oppressed is
               necessarily determined by their race, color, sex, or national origin. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Members of one race, color, sex, or national origin cannot and shouldn't attempt to
               treat others without respect to race, color, sex, or national origin. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An individual, by virtue of their race, color, sex, or national origin, bears
               responsibility for, or should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment
               because of, actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, color,
               sex, or national origin. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An individual, by virtue of their race, color, sex, or national origin, should be
               discriminated against or receive adverse treatment to achieve diversity, equity, or
               inclusion. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An individual, by virtue of their race, color, sex, or national origin, bears
               personal responsibility for and must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of
               psychological distress because of actions, in which the individual played no part,
               committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex, or national
               origin. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Such virtues as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, objectivity, and
               racial colorblindness are racist or sexist, or were created by members of a
               particular race, color, sex, or national origin to oppress members of another race,
               color, sex, or national origin. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">However, the law states it shouldn't be construed to prohibit discussion of the concepts
            listed above as part of a larger course of training, provided such training is given in
            an objective manner without endorsement of the concepts.</p>

            <li><span class="li">Consult legal counsel to discuss the impact of House Bill 7 on your employee
               training. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Revise employee training, if necessary, by July 1, 2022. </span></li>
