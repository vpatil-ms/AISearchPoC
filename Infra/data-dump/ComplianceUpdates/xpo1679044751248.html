         <p class="p">An employer may deny a flexible or predictable working arrangement that
            would be acceptable to the employee <span class="ph em">only if</span> granting such an

            to request reconsideration by the employer and the right to file a complaint, and
            include a copy of the FFWO Notice.</p>

         <p class="p">An employer that doesn't agree to a flexible or predictable working
            arrangement must engage in an interactive process with the employee to attempt in good
            faith to determine an arrangement that is acceptable to both the employee and
