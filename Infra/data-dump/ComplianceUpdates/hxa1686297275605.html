      <p class="p">Washington has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 5123), which prohibits employers from making a hiring decision based on an individual's off-duty use of cannabis or certain positive pre-employment drug test results. Senate Bill 5123 takes effect on January 1, 2024.</p>

         <p class="p">Employment drug tests can generally detect nonpsychoactive cannabis metabolites for up
            to 30 days after use. These test results may impact an employer's decision to hire an
            individual.</p>

            prohibiting an employer from making a hiring decision based on an individual's:</p>

               nonpsychoactive cannabis metabolites in their hair, blood, urine, or other bodily

               metabolites. Under the law, Washington employers will not be able to test for
               marijuana on a pre-employment drug test if such a test is not developed by January 1,
