      <p class="p">The Oregon Employment Department (OED) has released a <a class="xref" href="https://www.oregon.gov/employ/Agency/Documents/ED_14-2022_PFMLI_Temp_Rule_Employer_Size_eff_Nov.22_expire_May_19_2023.pdf" target="_blank">Temporary Administrative Order</a> that changes the
         method by which Oregon's paid leave program determines employer size from averaging over a
         quarter to averaging over 12 months. The order took effect on <span class="ph strong">November 22, 2022</span>, and is scheduled to end on <span class="ph strong">May 20,
            2023</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="toz1679044758870__section_q1z_kml_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The Director of the OED is required to establish a method by which the number of
            employees employed by an employer is determined. This impacts, among other things,
            whether an employer is liable for employer contributions. If an employer has fewer than
            25 employees, then no employer contribution is required (though such employers may
            voluntarily choose to contribute).</p>

         <p class="p">The method to determine employer size established in the original administrative rules
            used total quarterly employee count (every employee paid in the quarter) to calculate an
            annual average. The temporary order instead uses a snapshot monthly employee count
            (every employee paid for the pay period that includes the twelfth of the month) over the
            calendar year. The temporary order rules indicate that the monthly count more accurately
            accounts for seasonal employment and turnover in determining employer size because it
            includes fluctuations in employee counts in calculating the average.</p>

         <p class="p">The employee count includes the number of employees working in and outside of Oregon but
            excludes those hired temporarily to replace eligible employees during periods of Oregon
            Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance leave.</p>

         <p class="p">The <a class="xref" href="https://www.oregon.gov/employ/Agency/Documents/ED_14-2022_PFMLI_Temp_Rule_Employer_Size_eff_Nov.22_expire_May_19_2023.pdf" target="_blank">Temporary Administrative Order</a> includes several helpful
            hypothetical scenarios to illustrate the application of the new temporary order.</p>

      <section class="section" id="toz1679044758870__section_kyc_lml_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Next Steps:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Oregon employers should ensure that they are calculating employer size for paid family
            and medical leave contributions based on the new method outlined in the <a class="xref" href="https://www.oregon.gov/employ/Agency/Documents/ED_14-2022_PFMLI_Temp_Rule_Employer_Size_eff_Nov.22_expire_May_19_2023.pdf" target="_blank">Temporary Administrative Order</a>.</p>
