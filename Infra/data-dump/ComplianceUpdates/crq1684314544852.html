      <p class="p">Idaho recently enacted legislation (Senate Bill 1130) that, with limited exceptions, prohibits employers from requiring employees to obtain a coronavirus vaccination. Senate Bill 1130 became effective immediately on April 6, 2023.</p>

      <section class="section" id="crq1684314544852__section_v3t_ffy_mxb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Under Senate Bill 1130, employers doing business in the state are prohibited from
            requiring coronavirus vaccination as a term of employment, unless:</p>

         <ol class="concept" id="crq1684314544852__ol_uyf_hfy_mxb">
            <li><span class="li">Required by federal law. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The terms of employment include travel to foreign jurisdictions that require
               coronavirus vaccinations for entry into the jurisdiction. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The terms of employment require entry into a place of business or facility in a
               foreign jurisdiction and it requires a coronavirus vaccination for entry into the
               jurisdiction. </span></li>

         </ol>

         <p class="p">If an employee is required to obtain a coronavirus vaccination related to business
            travel to a foreign jurisdiction (#2 and #3), the requirement must:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="crq1684314544852__ul_vyf_hfy_mxb">
            <li><span class="li">Be included in the written employment contract between the employer and the employee
               (if one exists); or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If an employment contract doesn't exist, advance written notice must be provided to
               an impacted employee no less than 14 days prior to the employee being required to
               receive a vaccination. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The law also prohibits employers from providing or offering any different salary, hourly
            wage, or other ongoing compensation or benefits to an employee based on whether they
            have received a coronavirus vaccination. However, the law doesn't prohibit an employer
            from offering one-time incentives related to coronavirus vaccinations as long as they
            don't result in any different salary, hourly wage, or ongoing compensation or benefits
            being provided to an employee based on whether they have received a coronavirus
            vaccination.</p>

         <p class="p">Review all vaccination-related policies and procedures to ensure compliance with Senate
            Bill 1130. Consult legal counsel as needed.</p>
