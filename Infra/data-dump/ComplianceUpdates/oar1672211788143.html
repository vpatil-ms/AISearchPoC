      <p class="p">Connecticut has enacted legislation (House Bill 6380) that requires
         employers to, among other things, provide applicants with the wage range for positions.
         House Bill 6380 takes effect on <span class="ph strong">October 1, 2021</span>.</p>

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The applicant's request; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Prior to or at the time the applicant is made an offer of compensation. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Employers are also prohibited from failing/refusing to provide applicants with the wage range for a position upon hire, a change in the employee's position with the employer, or the employee's first request for a wage range.</p>
<p class="p">Under the law, a wage range is defined as the wages the employer anticipates relying on when setting wages for a position, such as an applicable pay scale; previously determined wage ranges for the position; actual wage ranges for current employees; or the employer's budgeted amount for the position.</p>

Under the revised standard, employers must provide equal pay for comparable (rather than equal) work when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and responsibility and performed under similar working conditions, unless the employer can demonstrate that the differential in pay is made pursuant to a:</p>
