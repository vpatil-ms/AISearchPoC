      <p class="p">Maine has enacted legislation that prohibits employers from taking adverse action against employees because they refuse to attend an employer-sponsored meeting that communicates the opinion of the employer about religious or political matters. The changes take effect October 25, 2023.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ilv1691664684033__section_v3s_l5q_kyb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">The protection from adverse action also applies to employees who refuse to receive or
            listen to communications from the employer if the purpose is to convey the opinion of
            the employer about religious or political matters.</p>

         <p class="p">The law defines <span class="q">“political matters”</span> as those relating to elections for political
            office, political parties, proposals to change legislation, proposals to change rules or
            regulations, proposals to change public policy and the decision to join or support any
            political party or political, civic, community, fraternal or labor organization.</p>

         <p class="p">The law defines <span class="q">“religious matters”</span> as those relating to religious belief,
            affiliation and practice and the decision to join or support any religious organization
            or association.</p>
