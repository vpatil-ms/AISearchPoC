      <section class="section" id="xgw1679044760287__section_dqz_43l_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Effective January 1, 2023, Senate Bill 1162 amends the state's Equal Pay Act as
            follows:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="xgw1679044760287__ul_iwy_v3l_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Upon request, all employers must: <ul class="ul" id="xgw1679044760287__ul_jwy_v3l_wwb">
                  <li><span class="li">Provide an employee with the pay scale for their current position; and </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Provide an applicant with the pay scale for the position for which they
                     applied. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">All employers must retain records of a job title and wage rate history for each
               employee. The records must be kept for the duration of employment plus three years
               after the end of the employment. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employer with 15 or more employees must include the pay scale for a position in
               any job posting. If the employer engages a third party to announce, post or publish a
               job posting, the employer must provide the pay scale to the third party. The third
               party is required to include the pay scale in the job posting. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">These changes are codified under <a class="xref" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=432.3.&amp;lawCode=LAB" target="_blank">Labor Code Section 432.3</a>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="xgw1679044760287__section_lc2_x3l_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">New Guidance:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The DIR has updated its answers to <a class="xref" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/california_equal_pay_act.htm" target="_blank">frequently asked questions about equal pay</a> to provide guidance on the new
            requirements. Here are some key points the updates address.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Defining pay scale</span></p>

         <p class="p">Under the law and guidance, pay scale is defined as a salary or hourly wage range. The
            guidance further provides that if the position's hourly or salary wage is based on a
            piece rate or commission, then the piece rate or commission range the employer
            reasonably expects to pay for the position must be included in the job posting.
            Employers are not required to include additional compensation, such as bonuses, tips or
            tangible benefits when posting a salary or hourly wage. The employer may include this
            information to make its recruitment efforts more competitive, and employers are
            cautioned other forms of compensation may be considered for equal pay purposes. A
            legally compliant job posting only requires the <span class="q">“salary or hourly wage range that the
               employer reasonably expects to pay for the position.”</span></p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Including the pay scale in job
            postings</span></p>

         <p class="p">The Labor Commissioner interprets the requirement to include the pay scale in any job
            posting to mean that the pay scale must be included within the job posting itself if the
            position may ever be filled in California, either in-person or remotely. Employers
            wouldn't comply with the requirement if they simply link to the salary range in an
            electronic posting or include a QR code in a paper posting that will take an applicant
            to the salary information, according to the guidance.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Determining whether an employer has 15 or more
               employees</span></p>

         <p class="p">Although the statute doesn't specify how employers should count employees, the Labor
            Commissioner interprets this requirement consistent with how it counts employees for the
            purpose of 2022 COVID-19 Supplemental Paid Sick Leave and minimum wage rates, as
            detailed in <a class="xref" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/SB3_FAQ.htm" target="_blank">previously issued FAQs on the topic</a>. As such, an employer
            will be deemed to have met the employee threshold if they have 15 or more employees at
            any point in a pay period, and at least one employee is currently located in California.
            For example, an employer with 14 employees in Oregon and one employee in California
            would be covered by the requirement to include the pay scale in any job posting.</p>
