      <p class="p">The Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) has recently released guidance on the Oregon Family Leave Act (OFLA) in the form of frequently asked questions.</p>

      <section class="section" id="gmq1672211784732__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">The OFLA requires employers with 25 or more employees to provide employees with unpaid job protected leave to care for themselves or their family members. Under OFLA, employees can take up to 12 weeks per year for:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Parental leave:</span> For the birth,
               adoption, or foster placement of a child. If an employee uses all 12 weeks for this
               purpose, they can take up to 12 more weeks for sick child leave. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Serious health condition:</span> For the
               employee's own condition, or to care for a spouse, parent, parent-in-law, or child. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Pregnancy disability leave:</span> Before or
               after the birth of child or for prenatal care. Employees can take up to 12 weeks of
               this leave in addition to 12 weeks for any of the other reasons listed here. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Sick child leave:</span> For an employee's
               child with an illness or injury that requires home care but is not serious. Employees
               can also take OFLA protected time if their child's school or provider is closed due
               to a statewide public health emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic school
               closures. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Additional reasons for leave:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"/></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Military family leave:</span> Up to 14 days
               if the employee's spouse is a service member who has been called to active duty or is
               on leave from active duty. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Bereavement leave:</span> Up to two weeks of
               leave after the death of a family member. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="gmq1672211784732__section_N10073_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">New Guidance Issued March 2021:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">BOLI has recently issued frequently asked questions clarifying various
            provisions of the OFLA. A brief summary is provided below.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Use of Accrued Paid Time Off:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The guidance explains that employers can require employees to use
            accrued paid leave during OFLA leave. It also indicates that an employer may choose the
            order in which employees may use the leave as long as the employer provides the employee
            written notice that accrued paid leave is to be used during OFLA leave. The notice must
            be provided prior to the start of the leave, or within five business days of the
            employee's notice when leave is unforeseeable.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">School Closures During Public Health
               Emergency:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The FAQs also address what is considered a school closure for purposes
            of sick child leave. The guidance says that if access to the physical location where the
            child receives instruction or care is closed due to a public health emergency, the
            school or child care provider is <span class="q">“closed”</span> for purposes of OFLA sick
            child leave. This is true even if instruction is being provided online or whether,
            through another format such as <span class="q">“distance learning,”</span> the child is
            still expected or required to complete assignments.</p>
