      <p class="p">Connecticut has enacted legislation (House Bill 6515) that makes clear that employers are prohibited from discriminating against applicants and employees because of their hair texture and protective hairstyles. House Bill 6515 is effective immediately.</p>

<p class="p">Under the law, protective hairstyles include, but aren't limited to, wigs, headwraps, and hairstyles such as individual braids, cornrows, locs, twists, Bantu knots, afros and afro puffs.</p>
<p class="p">Some examples of practices that could be found to violate this law include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Prohibiting twists, locs, braids, cornrows, Afros, Bantu knots, or fades. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Telling a Black applicant or employee with locs that they can't be in a customer-facing role unless they change their hairstyle. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Refusing to hire a Black applicant with cornrows because their hairstyle doesn't fit the <span class="q">“image”</span> the employer is trying to project. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Transferring an employee to a non-customer-facing position because a customer complained about their Afro. </span></li>

If your policy simply indicates that employees must maintain kempt hair, consider clarifying that kempt means that the hair is clean and well combed or arranged, and that employees can comply with a variety of hairstyles that meet those criteria.</p>
