      <p class="p">Illinois has enacted legislation (House Bill 117) that expands requirements related to the
         Illinois Secure Choice program to smaller employers. The changes take effect <span class="ph strong">January 1, 2022</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="eyj1672211791358__section_N1004D_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p"><a class="xref" href="https://www.ilsecurechoice.com/" target="_blank">Illinois Secure Choice</a> is a state-based payroll withholding savings program using Roth (post-tax) individual retirement accounts. Prior to House Bill 117, all employers with 25 or more employees in the state during every quarter of the previous calendar year were required to register with the program if they didn't offer a qualifying retirement plan and were in business at least two years. Employers required to participate in the program must also automatically enroll employees unless the employee opts out of it. These employers must also have an open enrollment period at least once every year for employees who previously opted out of the program.</p>
