      <p class="p">Delaware has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 1) that creates a paid family and medical leave program in the state. The program will be funded by payroll contributions to be paid by covered employers and employees beginning January 1, 2025. Employees may begin using such leave in 2026.</p>

      <section class="section" id="avw1672211802942__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Covered Employers:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers with 10 to 24 employees are covered by the law's parental leave
            requirements (see the <cite class="cite">Use of Leave</cite> section below). Larger employers are
            covered by all the leave requirements.</p>

         <p class="p">Employers with fewer than 10 employees and employers that close for 30
            consecutive days or more per year aren't covered by the law</p>

         <p class="p">For the purposes of counting the number of employees, those who meet the
            requirements of a covered individual (see below) or are reasonably expected to meet the
            requirements of a covered individual during the previous 12 months must be included.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="avw1672211802942__note_N10060_N10048_N10041_N10001"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employers with fewer than 10 employees may voluntarily participate in
               paid parental leave by providing notice to the Department of Labor. If an employer
               does opt-in, the employer must do so for at least 3 years.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Covered Employers:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The law defines employees as those who primarily report for work within
            the state. To be considered a covered individual who is eligible to use leave, the
            employee must:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Have been employed with the employer for at least 12 months; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Have at least 1,250 hours of service with the employer during the
               previous 12-month period. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Use of Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Beginning January 1, 2026, eligible employees are entitled to use paid
            leave for the following durations and reasons:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"/></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Parental leave:</span> Up to 12 weeks in a
               year for the birth, adoption, or placement of a child through foster care, as well as
               caring for the child during the first year after birth or placement.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Family caregiver leave:</span> Up to six
               weeks in any 24-month period to care for a family member (spouse, child, or parent)
               with a serious health condition.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Medical leave: </span>Up to six weeks in any
               24-month period for the employee's own serious health condition.</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Military family leave.</span> Up to six weeks
               in any 24-month period because the employee has a qualifying exigency arising out of
               a family member's deployment as a service member. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">A covered individual is eligible for a maximum of 12 weeks of paid leave
            in a year.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="avw1672211802942__note_N1009E_N10048_N10041_N10001"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>With notice to the Delaware Department of Labor and employees, an
               employer with fewer than 25 employees may elect to limit the exercise of parental
               leave during the first 5 years that benefits are payable (2026 to 2031). During that
               5-year period, the employer may provide no less than half of the employee's parental
               leave.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employee Notice:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employees must provide notice of their intent to use paid leave at least
            30 days in advance when feasible. If advance notice isn't feasible, the employee must
            provide notice as soon as practical.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Documentation and Certification:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Under the law, covered employers must collect and retain information
            verifying parental leave status, a serious health condition, or a qualifying exigency
            when an employee submits a request for such leave.</p>

         <p class="p">The employer must require that an employee support a request for leave
            based on a serious health condition with a certification issued by the employee's or a
            family member's healthcare provider In addition, the employer must require that an
            employee support a request for leave based on a serious health condition of a family
            member by documentation demonstrating the nature and extent of the relationship.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Processing Requests for Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p"> An employer must approve or deny an application for paid leave benefits
            under the law within five business days of receipt of a completed application that
            includes documentation necessary to review the claim. If the claim is denied, the
            employer must notify the covered individual of the reason for the denial. The employer
            must notify the Delaware Department of Labor within three business days of a claim being
            approved under the law.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Job Protection:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Upon returning from covered leave, the employee must be restored to the
            position held when the covered leave commenced, or to an equivalent position.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Continuation of Benefits</span></p>

         <p class="p">During covered leave, the employer must maintain any healthcare benefits
            the employee had before taking the leave. The employee must continue to pay their share
            of the cost of their healthcare benefits, if any.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employer Notice and Poster:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must provide written notice about the law to each employee
            when they are hired and when they request covered leave. See the <a class="xref" href="https://legis.delaware.gov/json/BillDetail/GenerateHtmlDocumentSessionLaw?sessionLawId=79186&amp;docTypeId=13&amp;sessionLawName=chp301" target="_blank">text of the law</a> for details on what must be
            included in the notice. Employers must also display a poster in English, Spanish, and
            any other language that is the first language spoken by at least 5% of the employer's
            workforce, if such a poster has been provided by the Department of Labor.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Contributions:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Contributions will begin on January 1, 2025. For 2025 and 2026, the
            total contribution rate is 0.8 percent, with the breakdown as follows:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">0.4 percent Medical Leave </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">0.08 percent Family Caregiver Leave </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">0.32 percent Parental Leave </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">For each component, employers may deduct up to 50 percent of the
            required contribution from each covered employee's wages.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Private Plans:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers with comparable paid leave benefits (private plans) may apply
            to the Delaware Department of Labor to opt out of the program in whole or in part. See
            the <a class="xref" href="https://legis.delaware.gov/json/BillDetail/GenerateHtmlDocumentSessionLaw?sessionLawId=79186&amp;docTypeId=13&amp;sessionLawName=chp301" target="_blank">text of the law</a> for details on the
            requirements for private plans to be approved.</p>
