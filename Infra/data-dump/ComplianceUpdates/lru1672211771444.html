            amended regulations. Among other things, the amendments change the definition of
            healthcare provider and the timing for the documentation requirements. For more
            information on the revised regulations, go </p>
<a class="xref" href="/covid19-state-emergency-leave-laws#federal" target="_blank">here</a>.<p class="p">The Department of Labor (DOL) has released a temporary
            rule implementing the leave provisions of the <a class="xref" href="https://sbshrs.adpinfo.com/covid19-stimulus-package" target="_blank">Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)</a>. The
            temporary rule was released on April 1, 2020 and is effective immediately. It defines
            key terms and makes important clarifications regarding the leave
         requirements.</p>

      <section class="section" id="lru1672211771444__section_N1005C_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">Effective April 1, 2020, the FFCRA requires employers with fewer than 500 employees to provide:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Emergency paid sick leave (EPSL):</span> Up
               to 80 hours of emergency paid sick leave (EPSL) to employees when they are unable to
               work (or telework) because of a number of COVID-19 related reasons. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Public health emergency leave
                  (PHEL)/Expanded FMLA:</span> Up to 12 weeks of leave to care for their son or
               daughter under 18 years of age if their school or place of care has been closed, or
               their childcare provider is unavailable, due to a public health emergency. As first
               written, the FFCRA indicated the first 10 days of PHEL may be unpaid, but the
               remainder must be paid. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Employers that provide paid leave under the FFCRA are entitled to certain tax credits.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Exemptions:</span></p>
<p class="p">The law also gave the DOL the authority to issue regulations exempting employers with fewer than 50 employees if it would jeopardize the viability of the business.</p>
<p class="p">Under the law, an employer of a healthcare provider or an emergency responder may elect to exclude the employee from the application of the EPSL and/or the PHEL requirement.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="lru1672211771444__section_N1007D_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Temporary Rule:</h2><p class="p">The following is a high-level summary of some of the definitions and clarifications included in the temporary rule.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Definitions:</span></p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"/></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Son or Daughter.</span> A biological,
               adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing
                  <span class="ph em">in loco parentis</span>, who is under 18 years of age, or 18
               years of age or older who is incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical
               disability. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Subject to a Quarantine or Isolation
                  Order.</span> Quarantine, isolation, containment, shelter-in-place, or stay-at-home
               orders issued by any federal, state, or local government authority that cause the
               employee to be unable to work even though their employer has work that the employee
               could perform but for the order. This also includes when a federal, state, or local
               government authority has advised categories of citizens (such as those of certain age
               ranges or with certain medical conditions) to shelter in place, stay at home,
               isolate, or quarantine, causing those categories of employees to be unable to work
               even though their employers have work for them. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Caring for an Individual in
                  Quarantine/Isolation/Self-Quarantine.</span> An employee's immediate family member,
               a person who regularly resides in the employee's home, or a similar person with whom
               the employee has a relationship that creates an expectation that the employee would
               care for the person if they were quarantined or self-quarantined. An employee may
               take EPSL under this provision if the employee is unable to perform work for their
               employer and if the individual depends on the employee to care for them and is either:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">Subject to a quarantine or isolation order as defined above;
                     or </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Has been advised to self-quarantine by a health care provider
                     because of a belief that the individual has, or may have, COVID-19, or is
                     particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Caring for a Son or Daughter.</span> Such
               leave is permitted <span class="ph em">only if</span> no other suitable person is
               available to care for the son or daughter during the period of such leave. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Full-Time Employees.</span> Those normally
               scheduled to work at least 40 hours each workweek. Under the law, a full-time
               employee is entitled to up to 80 hours of EPSL and a part-time employee is generally
               entitled to ESPL in the number of hours the employee is normally scheduled to work
               over two workweeks. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Healthcare Provider</span> (as amended by
               regulations effective September 16, 2020). Employees who are healthcare providers
               under the Family and Medical Leave Act and other employees who are employed to
               provide diagnostic services, preventive services, treatment services, or other
               services that are integrated with and necessary to the provision of patient care and,
               if not provided, would adversely impact patient care. This group includes employees
               who provide direct diagnostic, preventive, treatment, or other patient care services,
               such as nurses, nurse assistants, and medical technicians, according to the DOL. It
               also includes employees who directly assist or are supervised by a direct provider of
               diagnostic, preventive, treatment, or other patient care services. Finally, employees
               who don't provide direct healthcare services to a patient but are otherwise
               integrated into and necessary to the provision of those services—for example, a
               laboratory technician who processes medical test results to aid in the diagnosis and
               treatment of a health condition—are healthcare providers, according to the DOL.</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">An individual isn't a healthcare provider merely because their employer provides healthcare services or because the individual provides a service that affects the provision of healthcare services. For example, IT professionals, building maintenance staff, human resources personnel, cooks, food services workers, records managers, consultants, and billers aren't healthcare providers, even if they work at a hospital of a similar healthcare facility.</p>
<p class="p">To minimize the spread of the virus associated with COVID-19, the DOL encourages employers to be judicious when using this definition to exempt healthcare providers from the provisions of the FFCRA. For example, an employer may decide to exempt these employees from leave for caring for a family member but choose to provide them paid sick leave in the case of their own COVID-19 illness.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Emergency Responders.</span> Anyone necessary
               for the provision of transport, care, healthcare, comfort and nutrition of such
               patients, or others needed for the response to COVID-19. This includes but is not
               limited to military or national guard, law enforcement officers, correctional
               institution personnel, fire fighters, emergency medical services personnel,
               physicians, nurses, public health personnel, emergency medical technicians,
               paramedics, emergency management personnel, 911 operators, child welfare workers and
               service providers, public works personnel, and individuals with skills or training in
               operating specialized equipment or other skills needed to provide aid in a declared
               emergency, as well as individuals who work for such facilities employing these
               individuals and whose work is necessary to maintain the operation of the facility. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Clarifications:</span></p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Regular Rate of Pay</span></p>
<p class="p">For the purposes of EPSL, the employer must generally pay employees their regular rate of pay (as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act) or the applicable minimum wage, whichever is higher, up to a maximum of $511 per day (and a total of $5,110). However, leave to care for an individual on quarantine/isolation/self-quarantine or to care for a child whose school or daycare is closed or childcare provider is unavailable may be compensated at 2/3 of the employee's regular rate of pay (or the applicable minimum wage if higher), up to a maximum of $200 per day (and a total of $2,000).</p>
<p class="p">For the purposes PHEL/Expanded FMLA, the paid portion of leave must be at a rate of no less than two-thirds the employee's regular rate of pay, as defined by the FLSA, up to a maximum of $200 per day.</p>
<p class="p">The temporary rule requires employers to use a weighted average of the employee's regular rate of pay for the purposes of the leave, following this two-step method:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Use the rules contained in the FLSA (see a summary <a class="xref" href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/56a-regular-rate" target="_blank">here</a>) to compute the regular rate for each full workweek in which the employee has been employed over the lesser of: </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The six-month period ending on the date on which the employee takes leave; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The entire period of employment; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Compute the average of the weekly regular rates, weighted by the number of hours worked for each workweek. </span></li>

         </ul>
<div class="note note" id="lru1672211771444__note_N100E5_N1007D_N10041_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>For employees who are paid with commissions, tips, or piece rates, these amounts will be incorporated into the above calculation to the same extent they are included in the calculation of the regular rate under the FLSA.</p>
</div>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Business Closures and Furloughs</span></p>
<p class="p">The temporary rule further clarifies that if no work is available for the employee, the employee isn't entitled to leave. For instance, if the employer temporarily ceases operations because of a lack of work or the state has ordered the business to close because of COVID-19, employees wouldn't be entitled to leave under the FFCRA.</p>
<div class="note note" id="lru1672211771444__note_N100F2_N1007D_N10041_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Some state/local laws require employers to provide paid leave when the business closes because of a public health emergency.</p>
</div>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Small Employer Exemption:</span></p>
<p class="p">The exemption for employers with fewer than 50 employees is limited to the requirements to provide EPSL and PHEL/Expanded FMLA to an employee who is caring for their child due to their school or place of care being closed, or their childcare provider is unavailable, for COVID-19 related reasons if it would jeopardize the viability of the business.</p>
<p class="p">The temporary rule clarifies that to claim the exemption, an authorized officer of the business must determine that:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The leave requested would result in the small business's expenses and financial obligations exceeding available business revenues and cause the small business to cease operating at a minimal capacity; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The absence of the employee requesting such leave would entail a substantial risk to the financial health or operational capabilities of the business because of their specialized skills, knowledge of the business, or responsibilities; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">There are not sufficient workers who are able, willing, and qualified, and who will be available at the time and place needed, to perform the labor or services provided by the employee requesting leave, and this labor or services are needed for the small business to operate at a minimal capacity. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">To elect this exemption, the employer must document that a determination has been made pursuant to the above criteria. The employer should retain these records in its files for at least four years. The employer is still required to post the required FFCRA notice (see below).</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employee Documentation:</span></p>
<p class="p">As soon as practicable, an employee must provide documentation containing the following information:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Employee's name; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Date(s) for which leave is requested; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Qualifying reason for the leave; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Oral or written statement that the employee is unable to work because of a qualified reason. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Additional documentation is required depending on the reason for the need for leave:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">A quarantine or isolation order.</span> The
               employee must also provide the name of the government entity that issued the order. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">A healthcare provider advised
                  self-isolation.</span> The employee must also provide the name of the healthcare
               provider. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">To care for a son or daughter.</span> An
               employee must also provide:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">The name of the son or daughter; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The name of the school, place of care, or child care provider
                     that has closed or become unavailable; and </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">A representation that no other suitable person will be caring
                     for the son or daughter during the period for which the employee takes leave
                     under the FFCRA. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The employer may also request an employee to provide additional material needed for the employer to support a request for <a class="xref" href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/covid-19-related-tax-credits-for-required-paid-leave-provided-by-small-and-midsize-businesses-faqs#collapseCollapsible1585691612309" target="_blank">tax credits</a> pursuant to the FFCRA. The temporary rule indicates that an employer isn't required to provide leave if materials sufficient to support the applicable tax credit haven't been provided.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employer Notice and Recordkeeping:</span></p>
<p class="p">The FFCRA requires employers to <a class="xref" href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/posters/FFCRA_Poster_WH1422_Non-Federal.pdf" target="_blank">post a notice</a> about the law's leave requirements. An employer
            may satisfy this requirement by emailing or direct mailing this notice to employees, or
            by posting this notice on an employee information internal or external website.</p>
<p class="p">An employer is required to retain all documentation provided by employees for four years, regardless whether leave was granted or denied. If an employee provided oral statements to support their request for the leave, the employer is required to document and maintain this information.</p>
<p class="p">In order to claim tax credits from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the temporary rule also advises an employer to maintain the following records for four years:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">How the employer determined the amount of paid leave eligible for the credit, including records of work, telework, and leave; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">How the employer determined the amount of qualified health plan expenses that the employer allocated to wages; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Copies of any completed IRS Forms 7200 that the employer submitted to the IRS; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Copies of the completed IRS Forms 941 that the employer submitted to the IRS or, for employers that use third-party payers to meet their employment tax obligations, records of information provided to the third-party payer regarding the employer's entitlement to the credit claimed on IRS Form 941; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Other documents needed to support its request for tax credits pursuant to IRS <a class="xref" href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/covid-19-related-tax-credits-for-required-paid-leave-provided-by-small-and-midsize-businesses-faqs" target="_blank">applicable forms, instructions, and information</a> for the procedures that must be followed to claim a tax credit. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Paid and Unpaid PHEL/Expanded FMLA:</span></p>
<p class="p">The temporary rule clarifies that the unpaid portion of PHEL/Expanded FMLA is two weeks, rather than the <span class="q">“10 days”</span> used in the text of the FFCRA. The change to two weeks is meant to address situations in which employees don't work a five-day workweek. The employee may elect to substitute EPSL or other paid leave provided by the employer during this unpaid period, at two-thirds their regular rate of pay.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">EPSL and Other Sources of Leave:</span></p>
<p class="p">The temporary rule further clarifies that EPSL leave is in addition to, and not a substitute for, other sources of leave that the employee had already accrued, was already entitled to, or had already used, before the FFCRA became effective on April 1, 2020. Therefore, neither eligibility for, nor use of, EPSL may count against an employee's balance or accrual of any other source or type of leave.</p>

            requirements of the FFCRA and the rule. Employers should continue to monitor the
