      <p class="p">All employers must begin collecting premiums for Colorado's state-run paid family and medical leave insurance program on January 1, 2023. Details regarding recently released Private Plan Rules can also be found below.</p>

      <div class="note note" id="ivj1679044757697__note_N10040_N10039_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employers can also meet the legal requirements through a private plan, as opposed to the public, state-run plan. In general, a private plan must provide equal or greater benefits and protections than the public plan. All employers will need to collect and remit premiums under the public program beginning January 1, 2023, even if the employer intends to meet the requirements through a private plan. However, employers will be eligible for a refund of these premiums if they have received approval by the state for a private plan with an effective date on or before January 1, 2024.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ivj1679044757697__section_iwj_3zk_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Here are some key details about premiums for the program:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="ivj1679044757697__ul_crp_jzk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">If an employer has 10 or more employees, both the employer and employee must pay a
               share of the premium. For 2023 and 2024, the employer's and employee's share are set
               at 0.45 percent of wages each (for a total of 0.9 percent). If an employer has fewer
               than 10 employees, only the employee must pay a share of the premium (0.45 percent of
               wages in 2023 and 2024). Employers can estimate premium amounts using a <a class="xref" href="https://famli.colorado.gov/individuals-and-families/premium-and-benefits-calculator" target="_blank">calculator</a> created by the state. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers with 10 or more employees in the first quarter of 2023 must pay the
               employer share of the premium for all calendar quarters in 2023, even if they dip
               below that threshold during the year. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">When calculating the number of employees, employers must count all employees
               companywide who were employed during 20 or more workweeks in the previous calendar
               year. The number of employees employed by an employer will not affect an individual's
               right to FAMLI leave. More information regarding counting employees and employees
               living in Colorado but working in another state and employees working in Colorado but
               living in another state can be found in the FAMLI Division's <a class="xref" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12T86JZC4XOETi7Nv-JeWR0pOshi7L17_/view" target="_blank">Premium Rules</a> at 7 CCR 1107-1, Section 1.5.6. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers are prohibited from deducting the employee share of the premium for a pay
               period where there is a lack of sufficient wages to cover the premium for that pay
               period. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers are also prohibited from collecting missed premiums from employees in
               later pay periods. If an employer fails to deduct the maximum allowable employee
               share of the premium from wages paid for a pay period, the employer is considered to
               have elected to pay that portion of the employee share. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Premiums will become due to the state no later than the last day of the month
               immediately following the end of the calendar quarter for which the premiums have
               accrued. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Wages Subject to Premiums:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Premiums are paid on wages up to the federal Social Security Wage Cap, which is $160,200
            in 2023. For the purposes of the premiums, wages include:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="ivj1679044757697__ul_wsb_hzk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Salary or hourly wages, including wages as defined under the state's unemployment
               insurance law, and other compensation, including board, lodging, payments in kind,
               and/or other benefits provided as compensation for services performed by employees;
               and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Commissions, payments on a piecework basis, or bonuses earned for labor or services
               performed in accordance with the terms of any agreement between an employer and
               employee. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"> Any tips/gratuities and service charges when used by the employer in order to meet the
            minimum-wage requirements of federal or state law will be deemed to be wages. Wages will
            also include tips that are received while performing services that constitute employment
            and that are made known to the employer through a written statement furnished by the
            employee. Tips/gratuities and service charges will also be considered to be wages when
            the employer exercises significant control over the amount and distribution of money
            received by an employee as a tip/gratuity or service charge. An employer is considered
            to have significant control over tips/gratuities or service charges when they are
            collected by the employer and then redistributed to employees. </p>

         <p class="p">An employee's wages will be subject to premiums for all services performed within
            Colorado and for all services performed both within and outside of the state in certain
            scenarios. See the state's <a class="xref" href="https://famli.colorado.gov/proposed/adopted-rules" target="_blank">Premium
               Rules</a> for details.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Tax Deposits and Filings:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Premiums will become due to the state no later than the last day of the month
            immediately following the end of the calendar quarter for which the premiums have
            accrued.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Private Plans:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The <a class="xref" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EaQ3aaUck4rPZoT3_afywfKZNtxrDXgW/view" target="_blank">Regulations Concerning Private Plans, (7 CCR 1107-5)</a> were
            formally adopted on November 1, 2022. The complete Private Plan rules are now adopted
            and published on the state's <a class="xref" href="https://famli.colorado.gov/proposed/adopted-rules" target="_blank">rules
               page</a>. Some <a class="xref" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WwcfdSXhlzOa0TvLPiQ5XC8XUBjijQ4O/view" target="_blank">notable changes</a> from the proposed rules include but are not
            limited to:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="ivj1679044757697__ul_vhg_czk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Approved private plans must take effect no earlier than 60 days after the
               application date. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Private plan approvals are good for eight years, with more frequent data reporting
               and program attestation requirements. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers applying for private plan approval will be subject to an initial $500
               administration fee. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers with approved private plans will be responsible for an annual maintenance
               fee based on the administrative costs of their particular plan. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If an employer moves from a private plan to the state-run FAMLI plan, there will not
               be a fee to do so. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"> In order to qualify for an approved private plan, the plan must provide all of the same
            rights, protections, and benefits as the FAMLI program. All Colorado employers will
            begin paying premiums in 2023. Those who secure an approved private plan effective on or
            before January 1, 2024 may apply for a refund of paid 2023 premiums, minus the private
            plan administration fee. The state anticipates opening the private plan application
            process sometime between Q1 and Q3 next year and will provide how-to guides with
            step-by-step instructions to complete the process within My FAMLI+ Employer once the
            functionality is available. The deadline to submit a private plan application in order
            to receive a refund for 2023 premium payments is October 31, 2023. </p>
