      <p class="p">New Jersey has enacted Executive Order 192, which establishes specific health and safety
         measures for employers during COVID-19. <a class="xref" href="https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-192.pdf" target="_blank">Executive
            Order 192</a> takes effect November 5, 2020.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ehh1672211779998__section_N1004F_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Health &amp; Safety Requirements:</h2><p class="p">Under the Order, employers must adhere to the following health and safety protocols:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Require social distancing.</span> Individuals
               at the worksite must maintain at least six feet of distance from one another to the
               maximum extent possible, including but not limited to during worksite meetings,
               orientations and similar activities that would traditionally require individuals to
               be present in a single room or space, in common areas such as restrooms and
               breakrooms, and when individuals are entering and exiting the workplace. When the
               nature of an employee's work or the work area does not allow for six feet of
               distance, employers must ensure that employees wear a mask and install physical
               barriers between workstations wherever possible. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Provide sanitization.</span> Employers must
               provide sanitization materials, such as hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol and
               EPA approved sanitizing wipes at no cost to employees and visitors. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Require face coverings for customers and
                  visitors.</span> Customers and visitors must wear a cloth or disposable face mask,
               except when the individual is under two years of age or when it's impractical for an
               individual to do so. Employers may deny entry to the worksite to any customer or
               visitor who declines to wear a face mask, except when doing so would violate state or
               federal law. When a customer or visitor cannot wear a mask because of a disability,
               an employer may be required to provide them with a reasonable accommodation. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Require face coverings for employees.</span>
               Employers must require employees to wear a face covering and provide such coverings
               at the employer's expense. Employers may permit employees to remove face masks when
               the employees are situated at their workstations and are more than six feet from
               other individuals, or when an individual is alone in a walled office. Employers may
               deny entry to the worksite to any employee who declines to wear a face mask, except
               when doing so would violate state or federal law. When an employee cannot wear a mask
               because of a disability, an employer may be required to provide the employee with a
               reasonable accommodation. An employer may require an employee to produce medical
               documentation to support a claim that they are unable to wear a face mask because of
               a disability. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Enforce hygiene standards.</span> Ensure that
               employees practice regular hand hygiene, particularly when interacting with the
               public, and provide employees break time for repeated handwashing throughout the
               workday and access to adequate hand washing facilities. Employers may adopt policies
               that require employees to wear gloves in addition to regular hand hygiene. Where an
               employer requires its employees to wear gloves while at the worksite, the employer
               must provide such gloves to employees. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Clean and disinfect.</span> Routinely clean
               and disinfect high-touch areas, such as restrooms, handrails, door knobs, and safety
               equipment in accordance with Department of Health (DOH) and Center for Disease
               Control (CDC) guidelines. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Conduct daily health checks.</span> Prior to
               each shift, employers are required to conduct daily health checks of employees, such
               as temperature screenings, visual symptom checking, self-assessment checklists,
               and/or health questionnaires consistent with CDC guidance. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Send symptomatic employees home.</span>
               Employers must immediately separate and send home employees who appear to have
               COVID-19 symptoms, as defined by the CDC, upon arrival at work or who become sick
               during the day. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="ph strong">Notify employees exposed to COVID-19.</span>
               Employers are required to immediately notify all employees of any known exposure to
               COVID-19 consistent with confidentiality requirements of the Americans with
               Disabilities Act (ADA) and other applicable laws. </span></li>
