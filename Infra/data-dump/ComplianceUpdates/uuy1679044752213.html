      <p class="p">The Michigan Court of Claims has ruled that the legislature violated the state's Constitution when it adopted and then amended ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage and require paid sick leave. If left standing, the ruling means the original versions of those laws would apply and the minimum wage could increase to $12.00 per hour and paid sick leave requirements could expand significantly as early as February 19, 2023.</p>

      <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Updated:</span> A three-judge panel of the Michigan
         Court of Appeals has issued a ruling, which, if left standing, means the minimum wage will
         stay at $10.10 per hour throughout 2023 and paid sick leave requirements would remain the
         same as they were in previous years.</p>

      <section class="section" id="uuy1679044752213__section_N10044_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph strong"><span class="ph strong">Background</span></span></p>
<p class="p">A proposed minimum-wage increase and paid-sick-leave requirement were set to be part of the voter ballot in the general election in November 2018. However, the Michigan legislature stepped in to adopt both measures in September 2018, removing them from the ballot. Because many in the legislature opposed the ballot measures, the passage of the laws was seen as a strategic maneuver to give the legislature a better opportunity to amend the laws and scale them back, which the legislature eventually did with Senate Bill 1171 and Senate Bill 1175 in the same legislative session.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong"><span class="ph strong">Michigan Court
                  of Claims Decision:</span></span></p>
<p class="p">On July 19, 2022, the Michigan Court of Claims found that the legislature's maneuver was unconstitutional and voided the amended/scaled-back versions of the laws. The decision as it stands would mean the original versions of the laws would apply. On July 29, 2022, the same court entered an order delaying the effect of its decision until February 19, 2023, to give employers and the state agencies additional time to accommodate the changes.</p>

<p class="p"><span class="ph strong"><span class="ph strong">Summary of
                  Changes:</span></span></p>
<p class="p">Here's a summary of what would change if the original laws do go into effect on February 19, 2023.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Minimum wage:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">The minimum wage for the remainder of 2023 would be the product of multiplying $12.00 per hour by the rate of inflation. The inflation-adjusted minimum wage would be calculated by the state and announced by the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity (MDLEO) in the fall of this year. It would apply from February 19, 2023 through December 31, 2023. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The minimum cash wage for tipped employees would increase to 90 percent of the minimum wage for the remainder of 2023. In 2024 and thereafter, the minimum cash wage for tipped employees would be 100 percent of the minimum wage. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The minimum wage would also be adjusted for inflation each subsequent year. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Paid sick leave:<ul class="ul">
                  <li><span class="li">The paid sick leave requirement would apply to <span class="ph em">all
                        employers</span> (as opposed to those with 50 or more employees) and <span class="ph em">all employees</span>. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The accrual rate would change and the number of hours that can be accrued would increase. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The reasons for which employees may take leave would expand. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The definition of covered family members would expand. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The rules regarding pay during leave would change. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Employer and employee notice requirements would change. </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Recordkeeping requirements would expand. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Paid Sick Leave Details:</span></p>
<p class="p">Here are details on the paid sick leave rules if the original laws go into effect on February 19, 2023.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Coverage:</span></p>
<p class="p">The paid sick leave requirement would generally apply to all employers and all employees who work in the state.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Accrual and Carryover:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employees would be entitled to accrue one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers would be required to carryover unused sick leave to the following year. While there are generally no caps on accrual and carryover, employers may establish caps on use.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Use:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employees of employers with 10 or more employees (for 20 or more calendar weeks
            in either the current or preceding year) would be entitled to use up to 72 hours of
            accrued <span class="ph em">paid</span> sick leave per year. For the purpose of
            determining whether the 10-employee threshold is met, all individuals working for
            compensation on a full-time, part-time or a temporary basis must be counted.</p>
<p class="p">Employees of employers with fewer than 10 employees would also be entitled to use up to 72 hours of accrued sick leave per year, but only 40 hours of it must be paid (the other 32 hours may be unpaid).</p>
<p class="p">Employees would be entitled to use accrued sick leave for the following purposes:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employee's or a family member's mental or physical illness, injury or health condition </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The employee's or a family member's medical diagnosis, care or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition, or preventive medical care </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">For medical care, counseling, obtaining legal services, or participating in a civil or criminal proceeding when the employee or a family member is a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The closure of the employee's place of business due to a public health emergency, the closure of their child's school or place of care due to a public health emergency, or when a health care provider has determined that the employee's or a family member's presence in the community would jeopardize the health of others </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Family member would be defined as:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A child, stepchild, legal ward, a child of a domestic partner, or a child to whom the employee stands in place of a parent </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Grandchild </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Grandparent </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Parent, or parent of spouse or domestic partner </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Sibling </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Spouse or domestic partner </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Any other individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employee Notice:</span></p>
<p class="p">If the need for leave is foreseeable, employers may require employees to provide up to seven days' advance notice. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, employers may require employees to provide notice as soon as practical.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employer Notice:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers would be required to provide written notice to existing employees and new hires about their rights under the law. The notice must be provided in English, Spanish and any other language spoken by at least 10 percent of the employer's workforce (provided the state has translated the notice into that language). Employers must also display a poster in the workplace.</p>
<p class="p">The state's Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs is responsible for creating a notice and poster for employers to use.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Records:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers would be required to retain a record of all hours worked and sick leave taken by employees for at least three years.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Documentation:</span></p>
<p class="p">If employees use more than three consecutive days of sick leave, employers would be able to require reasonable documentation that the leave has been used for a covered reason. See <a class="xref" href="http://legislature.mi.gov/documents/2017-2018/initiative/pdf/MITimeToCareFINAL.pdf" target="_blank">the law</a> for details on requiring documentation.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Pay During Leave:</span></p>
<p class="p">During paid sick leave, employers would be required to pay employees their normal hourly wage or the minimum wage, whichever is greater. For employees whose hourly wage varies depending on the work performed, the <span class="q">“normal hourly wage”</span> would be the average hourly wage during the pay period immediately prior to the use of the leave.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Relationship to Existing PTO Policies:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers would be able to use their existing paid time off policy to satisfy the law, as long as:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Leave accrues at a rate equal to or greater than required by the law; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employees are entitled to use at least the same amount of leave that the law requires; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The leave may be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as the law requires. </span></li>

         </ul>
<div class="note note" id="uuy1679044752213__note_N10161_N10044_N10039_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employers with fewer than 10 employees must allow employees to use paid leave before using unpaid leave.</p>
</div>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Retaliation Prohibited:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers would be prohibited from retaliating against employees for exercising their rights under the law.</p>
