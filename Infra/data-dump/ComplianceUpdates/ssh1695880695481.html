      <p class="p">New Hampshire has enacted legislation (House Bill 358), which requires employers to provide unpaid time for employees to express milk. House Bill 358 takes effect on July 1, 2025.</p>

      <section class="section" id="ssh1695880695481__section_vdf_gz1_yyb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Employers with six or more employees working in New Hampshire must provide employees
            that need to express milk:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="ssh1695880695481__ul_a2k_vz1_yyb">
            <li><span class="li">An unpaid break of approximately 30 minutes to pump, for every three hours of work,
               which may be taken with break or meal periods provided by the employer. <div class="note note" id="ssh1695880695481__note_gjt_wz1_yyb"> 
                  <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The law does not provide a definition for <span class="q">“approximately.”</span></p>

               </div>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Reasonable and sufficient spaces in the workplace (permanent or temporary, but not a
               bathroom) for an employee to express milk for at least one year following the birth
               of a child. The spaces must be: <ul class="ul" id="ssh1695880695481__ul_c2k_vz1_yyb">
                  <li><span class="li">Within a reasonable walk of the employee's worksite (unless the employer and
                     employee mutually agree to a different location); </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Clean, shielded from view, and free from intrusion from co-workers and the
                     public; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Outfitted with (at a minimum) an electrical outlet and a chair, if reasonable;
                     and </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">Made available when requested (if the space is not solely used for employees
                     expressing milk). </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Employers and employees may negotiate different terms for reasonable break periods other
            than those provided by the law, but employers cannot require employees to make up time
            for breaks used to express milk.</p>

         <div class="note note" id="ssh1695880695481__note_d2k_vz1_yyb"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Under the law, expressing milk is the initiation of lactation by manual or mechanical
               means, but it does not include breastfeeding.</p>

<p class="p">Additionally, the law does not cover an individual that volunteers their services for a charitable or religious facility without expectation or promise of pay.</p>
