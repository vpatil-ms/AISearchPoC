<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Temporary Policy for Remote I-9 Document
               Inspection:</span></p>
<p class="p">Under the temporary policy, if employees hired on or after April 1, 2021 work exclusively in a remote setting due to COVID-19-related precautions, they are temporarily exempt from the physical inspection requirements until they undertake non-remote employment on a regular, consistent, or predictable basis, or the extension of the flexibilities related to such requirements is terminated, whichever is earlier. In situations in which the policy applies, employers must inspect the Section 2 documents remotely (such as, over video link, fax or email, etc.) and obtain, inspect, and retain copies of the documents, within three business days for purposes of completing Section 2.</p>
<p class="p">Once normal operations resume, all employees who were onboarded using remote
            verification, must report to their employer within <span class="ph strong">three
               business days</span> for in-person verification of identity and employment eligibility
            documentation for Form I-9. Once acceptable documents have been physically inspected,
            the employer should add <span class="q">“documents physically examined”</span> with the
            date of inspection to the Section 2 additional information field on the Form I-9, or to
            Section 3 as appropriate. Employers should enter <span class="q">“COVID-19”</span> as the
            reason for the physical inspection delay.</p>
<p class="p">Employers that use this option must provide written documentation of their remote onboarding and telework policy for each employee. This burden rests solely with the employer.</p>
