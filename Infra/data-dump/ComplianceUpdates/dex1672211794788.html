      <p class="p">California has enacted legislation (Assembly Bill 654) that clarifies the requirements for notifying employees when they have had potential exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace. The law also clarifies the requirements for notifying local health officials when there is a COVID-19 outbreak. Assembly Bill 654 takes effect immediately.</p>

      <section class="section" id="dex1672211794788__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">Under existing law, employers that receive a notice of potential exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace must take certain actions within one business day, including, but not limited to providing:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A written notice to all employees who were on the premises at the same worksite as the qualifying individual within the infectious period that they may have been exposed to COVID-19. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A written notice to the exclusive representative, if any, of the employee. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">All employees who may have been exposed and the exclusive representative, if any, with information regarding COVID-19-related benefits to which the employee may be entitled under applicable federal, state, or local laws. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Notice to all employees (and to any exclusive representative) of the employer's disinfection and safety plan. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">If an employer is notified of enough COVID-19 cases to meet the State Department of Public Health's definition of an outbreak, the employer must notify the local public health agency of the names, numbers, occupations, and worksites of <span class="q">“qualifying individuals,”</span> which are defined as any individuals who have:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">A laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A positive COVID-19 diagnosis from a licensed health care provider. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A COVID-19-related order to isolate provided by a public health official. </span></li>

      <section class="section" id="dex1672211794788__section_N1007F_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Assembly Bill 654:</h2><p class="p">Assembly Bill 654 clarifies that:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The written notice on COVID-19-related benefits must be provided <span class="ph em">to all employees who were on the premises at the same worksite as
                  the qualifying individual within the infection period.</span></span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The written notice of potential exposure must be provided <span class="ph strong">to the exclusive representative of qualifying individuals and employees who had
                  close contact with the qualifying individuals.</span></span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A written notice must be provided to all employees who were on the premises at the same worksite as the qualifying individual within the infectious period (and any exclusive representative) of the cleaning and disinfection plan that the employer is implementing per the guidelines of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the COVID-19 prevention program per the Cal-OSHA COVID-19 Emergency Temporary Standards. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The definition of <span class="q">“close contact”</span> is being within six feet of a COVID-19 case for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more in any 24-hour period within or overlapping with the high-risk exposure period.

                  <li><span class="li">For individuals who test positive who never develop COVID-19 symptoms, from two days before until ten days after the specimen for their first positive test for COVID-19 was collected. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The notice of an outbreak to the local public health agency must be provided within 48 hours or one business day, whichever is later. </span></li>
