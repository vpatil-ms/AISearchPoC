      <p class="p">The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) has approved COVID-19 Prevention Non-Emergency Regulations (NER) to replace Emergency Temporary Standards (ETS). On February 3, 2023, the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) approved the new COVID-19 prevention regulations, which means that these new regulations are in effect as of February 3, 2023 and will remain in effect for the next two years.</p>

      <section class="section" id="efo1679044761677__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details</h2>
         <p class="p">The NER includes some of the same requirements found in the ETS as well as new
            provisions.</p>
</section>

      <section class="section" id="efo1679044761677__section_rdl_r5l_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Key Changes</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Here are some of the key changes contained in the NER:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="efo1679044761677__ul_oh5_r5l_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Employers are no longer required to maintain a stand-alone COVID-19 Prevention Plan.
               Instead, employers must now address COVID-19 as a workplace hazard under the
               requirements found in <a class="xref" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/title8/3203.html" target="_blank">Section
                  3203</a> (Injury and Illness Prevention Program, IIPP), and include their
               COVID-19 procedures to prevent this health hazard in their written IIPP or in a
               separate document. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The regulations do not require employers to pay employees while they are excluded
               from work because of COVID-19. Instead, the regulations require employers to provide
               employees with information regarding COVID-19-related benefits that they may be
               entitled to under federal, state or local laws; their employer's leave policies; or
               leave guaranteed by contract. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Employers are no longer required to make testing available at no cost/during paid
               time to employees who have COVID-19 symptoms but didn't have close contact in the
               workplace. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Instead of having specific training requirements, the NER merely states that
               employers must provide effective COVID-19 hazard prevention training to employees
               during their IIPP training. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li"><span class="q">“Close contact”</span> is now defined by looking at the size of the workplace in which
               the exposure takes place. For indoor airspaces of 400,000 or fewer cubic feet,
                  <span class="q">“close contact”</span> is now defined as sharing the same indoor airspace with a
               COVID-19 case for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period
               during the COVID-19 case's infectious period. For indoor airspaces of greater than
               400,000 cubic feet, "close contact" is defined as being within six feet of a COVID-19
               case for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period during the
               COVID-19 case's infectious period. Offices, suites, rooms, waiting areas, break or
               eating areas, bathrooms, or other spaces that are separated by floor-to-ceiling walls
               shall be considered distinct indoor spaces. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The regulations use the definition of <span class="q">“infectious period”</span> found in the most
               recent California Department of Public Health (CDPH) <a class="xref" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Beyond-Blueprint.aspx__;%21%21L8-7AA%21Xxp5uftPPnX-2YWqxaPkSiTbjzec3IpkmUglLiQhj4_FQi13Qbgrj1cQ4Kj9xJPv9IWqjLJf5_8p%24" target="_blank">State Public Health Officer Order</a>. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">The regulations give more options for employers to provide notice to close contacts. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Instead of zero new cases, employers may exit from outbreak protocol when there is
               one or no new COVID-19 cases within a 14-day period. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Cal/OSHA is updating its <a class="xref" href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/Non_Emergency_Regulations/" target="_blank">resources</a> to assist employers with understanding their
               obligations required by the NER. </span></li>

<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Provide face coverings and ensure they are worn by employees when CDPH requires their use. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Review CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face Masks to learn when employees must wear face coverings. Employees still have the right to wear face coverings at work and to request respirators from the employer when working indoors and during outbreaks. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Report information about employee deaths, serious injuries, and serious occupational illnesses to Cal/OSHA, consistent with existing regulations. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Make COVID-19 testing available at no cost and during paid time to employees following a close contact. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Exclude COVID-19 cases from the workplace until they are no longer an infection risk and implement policies to prevent transmission after close contact. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Review CDPH and Cal/OSHA guidance regarding ventilation, including CDPH and Cal/OSHA Interim Guidance for Ventilation, Filtration, and Air Quality in Indoor Environments. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Develop, implement and maintain effective methods to prevent COVID-19 transmission
               by improving ventilation. </span></li>
