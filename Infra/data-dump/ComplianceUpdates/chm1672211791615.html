      <p class="p">Minnesota has enacted legislation (Senate Bill 9) that will expand a
         requirement to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnancy. Senate Bill 9 takes effect
            <span class="ph strong">January 1, 2022</span>.</p>

      <section class="section" id="chm1672211791615__section_w158ab1b5b3_w159ab1b5_w160ab1"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">Currently, Minnesota requires employers with 21 or more employees at any one site to provide reasonable accommodations for health conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth if the employee requests an accommodation with the advice of her health care provider or certified doula, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the business. Reasonable accommodations include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Temporary transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Seating; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Frequent restroom breaks; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Limits to heavy lifting. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Pregnant employees may not be required to obtain the advice of their health care provider or doula, and an employer cannot claim undue hardship, for the following accommodations:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">More frequent restroom, food, and water breaks; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Seating; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Limits on lifting over 20 pounds. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Existing Minnesota state law also requires that employers provide nursing mothers with reasonable unpaid break time to express milk and a private a room or other location for milk expression, other than a bathroom or toilet stall, with access to an electrical outlet and in close proximity to the worksite.</p>

      <section class="section" id="chm1672211791615__section_w161ab1b5b5_w162ab1b5_w163ab1"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Senate Bill 9:</h2><p class="p">Under Senate Bill 9, beginning January 1, 2022, employers with 15 or more employees must comply with the reasonable accommodation requirements described above.</p>
<p class="p">Senate Bill 9 also amends the state's lactation accommodation law by prohibiting employers from reducing an employee's pay for the time used for the purpose expressing milk. This means that lactation breaks must be paid beginning January 1, 2022.</p>

      <section class="section" id="chm1672211791615__section_w164ab1b5b7_w165ab1b5_w166ab1"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compliance Recommendations:</h2><p class="p">Minnesota employers should review policies and practices to ensure that they comply with the changes made by Senate Bill 9.</p>
<div class="note note" id="chm1672211791615__note_w167ab1b5b7b2_w168ab1b5b7_w169ab1b5_w170ab1"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>In the Employee Handbook Wizard, the Pregnancy and Parental Leave and Accommodation for Minnesota Employees will be separated into two policies closer to the effective date of Senate Bill 9. The Pregnancy and Parental Leave policy will apply to employers with 21 or more employees, and the Pregnancy Accommodations Policy will apply to those with 15 or more employees. There is also a new a Break Time for Nursing Mothers policy for Minnesota employees. See the Alerts section, found on the Employee Handbook Wizard home page, for more information and to make these changes in your handbook.</p>
