      <p class="p">The New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission (NJCRC) has released guidance and provided a sample form to help employers address workplace impairment due to employee cannabis use.</p>

      <section class="section" id="lts1679044754623__section_dkh_ntk_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">In 2021, Governor Phil Murphy signed Assembly Bill 21, also known as the
               <a class="xref" href="/new-jersey-adds-employment-protections-for-recreational-marijuana-users" target="_blank">New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory,
               Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act</a>, into law,
            which:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="lts1679044754623__ul_jys_ntk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Legalized adult use of recreational cannabis; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Restricted an employer's ability to test for and take adverse action against an
               employee based upon an employee's off-duty cannabis use; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Created a Commission to train Workplace Impairment Recognition Experts (WIREs) to
               detect and identify workplace use or impairment and help investigate workplace
               accidents. </span></li>

         </ul>

      </section>

      <section class="section" id="lts1679044754623__section_N10064_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         <p class="p">The NJCRC has released <a class="xref" href="https://www.nj.gov/cannabis/documents/businesses/Business%20Resources/Workplace%20Impairment%20Guidance%20922.pdf" target="_blank">new guidance</a> on workplace impairment for employers while it
            finishes its standards for WIRE certifications.</p>

         <p class="p">The new guidance clarifies the process for demonstrating physical signs or other
            evidence of impairment that are sufficient to support an employer's adverse employment
            action against an employee for the employee's suspected cannabis use or impairment
            during work.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Physical Signs of Impairment:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Under the guidance, an employer may use the following as physical signs or evidence to
            establish reasonable suspicion of cannabis use or impairment at work:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="lts1679044754623__ul_dbb_ktk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">A cognitive impairment test; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A scientifically valid, objective, consistently repeatable, standardized, and
               automated test of an employee's impairment; and/or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An ocular scan. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The guidance clarifies that a scientifically reliable and objective method that tests
            for marijuana is, by itself, insufficient to take adverse employment action against an
            employee. However, the following may be sufficient to support adverse employment
            action:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="lts1679044754623__ul_ebb_ktk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Drug test results showing cannabinoid metabolites in an employee's bodily fluids;
               and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Evidence-based documentation that captures physical signs or other evidence of
               impairment during an employee's work hours. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Evidence-Based Documentation:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers may also designate an interim staff member or third-party contractor
            (designee) to assist in determining suspected cannabis use during an employee's work
            hours. This individual should be sufficiently trained to determine impairment and
            qualified to complete a Reasonable Suspicion Observation Report.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Reasonable Suspicion Observation
            Report:</span></p>
<p class="p">Employers may use a Reasonable Suspicion Observation Report, such as the NJCRC's <a class="xref" href="https://www.nj.gov/cannabis/documents/businesses/Business%20Resources/Workplace%20Impairment%20Guidance%20Sample%20Form.pdf" target="_blank">sample form</a>, to document an employee's behavior, physical signs, and evidence that supports why they reasonably suspect an employee of being under the influence during work.</p>
<div class="note note" id="lts1679044754623__note_N100B9_N10064_N10039_N10001"> <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Employers that already use a Reasonable Suspicion Observation Report to determine when drug testing is necessary may continue to do so.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">The guidance also states that employers should establish a standard operating procedure for completing a Reasonable Suspicion Observation Report that includes:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="lts1679044754623__ul_wzk_dtk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">The employee's manager or supervisor, or an employee at those levels; and </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">A designee, or a second manager or supervisor. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="lts1679044754623__section_b5f_btk_wwb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Next Steps:</h2>
         
         <ul class="ul" id="lts1679044754623__ul_z12_ftk_wwb">
            <li><span class="li">Review and revise drug-testing and drug-free workplace policies and procedures. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Train HR personnel and managers on: <ul class="ul" id="lts1679044754623__ul_ab2_ftk_wwb">
