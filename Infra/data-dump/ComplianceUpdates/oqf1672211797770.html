      <p class="p">Tennessee has passed legislation (Senate Bill 9014) that adds protections for employees who refuse to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination. Senate Bill 9014 is effective immediately.</p>

      <section class="section" id="oqf1672211797770__section_N10048_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2><p class="p">Under the law, employers are prohibited from compelling a person to provide proof of their vaccination from COVID-19 if the person objects to receiving the vaccine. The law also provides that a person who is terminated because of their refusal to receive a COVID-19 vaccine is eligible for unemployment benefits.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Unemployment Benefits:</span></p>
<p class="p">The law additionally prohibits an individual from being disqualified from unemployment benefits if a claimant left their employment because the claimant's employer required its employees to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and the claimant failed or refused to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Retaliation prohibited:</span></p>
<p class="p">Under the law, employers cannot take adverse action to compel a person to provide proof of vaccination if the individual objects to receiving a COVID-19 vaccine for any reason. This includes denying employment or discharging, threatening, or otherwise discriminating against an employee in any manner that affects their employment, including compensation, terms, conditions, locations, rights, immunities, promotions, or privileges.</p>
