      <p class="p">The City of Philadelphia has enacted Bill 220051-A, which amends its Public Health Emergency law (PHEL). Bill 220051-A took effect on March 9, 2022 and is set to expire on December 21, 2023.</p>

      <section class="section" id="gvi1679044748017__section_N10040_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background:</h2><p class="p">In September 2020, Philadelphia issued a paid sick leave ordinance, Ordinance 200303, that amended the City's paid sick and safe time law. The amendments required new public health emergency leave (PHEL) and pay protections for employees, gig workers and others that did not receive leave under the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA).</p>

      <section class="section" id="gvi1679044748017__section_N1004A_N10039_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Philadelphia has passed Bill 220051-A, which requires employers with at
            least 25 employees to provide paid sick leave (PHEL) to employees who:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Work in the City, or work for an employer in the City (normally) but
               are teleworking from somewhere else due to COVID-19; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Work for their employer from multiple (or mobile) locations if they
               spend 51% or more of their time in the City. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <div class="note note" id="gvi1679044748017__note_N1005E_N1004A_N10039_N10001"> 
            <p class="p"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>PHEL leave is <span class="ph em">in addition</span> to all other paid
               leave benefits. Employers cannot reduce PHEL leave by the amount of paid leave that
               an employee has previously received, and they cannot require an employee to use other
               paid leave that's available to them before the employee is allowed to use PHEL
               leave.</p>

         </div>

         <p class="p">Bill 220051-A covers all employees who are expected to report in-person
            to their jobs.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Covered Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employees may use PHEL leave to:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Recover from, or avoid exposing others to, COVID-19; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Care for family members who have COVID-19 or have symptoms that
               might jeopardize others' health; </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Care for a child whose school or place of care has closed due to
               COVID-19; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Receive a COVID-19 vaccine or booster shot (and address any side
               effects related to such vaccination). </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Amount of Leave:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must provide (rather than have employees accrue) up to 40
            hours of paid sick of leave to employees who work 40 or more hours a week, unless the
            employer sets a higher limit. If an employee works less than forty hours per week, the
            employee is entitled to leave that is equal to the amount of time that they're scheduled
            to work (or actually work) on average in a seven-day period (whichever is greater).</p>

         <p class="p">Employees whose hours fluctuate weekly must calculate leave based on the
            average number of daily hours they were scheduled to over the past 90 days of work.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Policy Requirements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">If employees receive paid leave in 2022 that can be used for the same
            purposes and under the same conditions as COVID-19 leave, employers are not required to
            change any existing policies or provide additional paid leave when:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">The employees who complete a majority of their work by telework
               receive at least 80 hours of paid leave; or </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An employer's policy provides 120 hours (or more) of paid leave.
            </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Pay Requirements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must compensate employees with their regular rate of pay and
            their regular benefits.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Notice Requirements:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Employers must provide <a class="xref" href="https://www.phila.gov/media/20220315165758/2022-COVID-19-Pandemic-Paid-Sick-Leave-NOTICE-POSTER-ENG.pdf" target="_blank">notice</a> of the updated PHEL law to employees
            by <span class="ph strong">March 24, 2022</span>. Employees must notify their employer of
            the need to use PHEL leave as practical and feasible when the need is foreseeable.</p>
