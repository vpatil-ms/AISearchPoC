         </ul>
<p class="p">Covered employers must ensure that employees who aren't fully vaccinated and who report at least once every seven days to a workplace where other individuals such as coworkers or customers are present are:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Tested for COVID-19 at least once every seven days; and</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Provide documentation of the most recent COVID-19 test result to the employer no later than the seventh day following the date the employee last provided a test result. </span></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">If an employee doesn't provide documentation of a COVID-19 test result as required, the employer must keep that employee removed from the workplace until they provide a test result.</p>
<p class="p">In addition, when an employee has received a positive COVID-19 test, or has been diagnosed with COVID-19 by a licensed healthcare provider, the employer must remove the employee from the workplace immediately and until they meet criteria for return and may not require that employee to undergo COVID-19 testing for 90 days following the date of their positive test or diagnosis.</p>

<p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Recordkeeping:</span></p>
<p class="p">Covered employers must maintain a record and a roster of each employee's vaccination status. Employers must also maintain a record of each test result provided by each employee.
