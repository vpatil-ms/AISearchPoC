      <p class="p">On March 23, 2022, Governor Jim Justice signed into law Senate Bill <a class="xref" href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Text_HTML/2022_SESSIONS/RS/bills/SB245%20SUB1%20ENR.pdf" target="_blank">245</a> (SB 245) eliminating the requirements that wage payment by
         payroll card and direct deposit be agreed upon in writing by both employer and employee.
         The legislation becomes effective June 9, 2022.</p>

      <section class="section" id="jlk1672211801208__section_N1004F_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p">SB 245 provides that employers must pay wages at least twice every month
            in a <span class="q">“manner of the person, firm, or corporation's choosing.”</span> No
            more than 19 days are allowed between payments unless agreed to by the employee and
            employer. Wage payments may be made:</p>

         <p class="p">(1) In lawful money of the United States;</p>

         <p class="p">(2) By check or money order;</p>

         <p class="p">(3) By deposit or electronic transfer of immediately available funds
            into an employee's payroll card account in a federally insured depository institution;
            or</p>

         <p class="p">(4) By direct deposit in a financial institution chosen by the
            employee</p>

         <p class="p">Where an employer uses payroll cards for employee wage payments, the
            employer must:</p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Provide a full written disclosure of any applicable fees associated
               with the payroll card. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Ensure that the employee has the ability to make at least one
               withdrawal or transfer from the payroll card per pay period without cost or fee to
               the employee. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Ensure that the employee has the ability to make in-network
               withdrawals or transfers from the payroll card without cost or fee to the employee
               for any amount contained on the card. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Allow an employee to choose to have their wages deposited into a
               financial institution of the employee's choosing by the providing the employer with
               the name of the financial institution, the type of account (e.g., checking or
               savings) and the account number. Should the employee fail to provide sufficient
               information to facilitate direct deposit, the employer may pay the employee wages
               owed by payroll card. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">The law also separately addresses assignment of wages and wage payments
            to terminated employees.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Assignment of Wages</span></p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">No assignment of or order for future wages may be valid for a period
               exceeding one year from the date of the assignment or order. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">An assignment or order shall be in writing and must specify the
               total amount due. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Three-fourths of the periodical earnings or wages of the assignor
               (e.g., employee) are all times exempt from assignment or order. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Terminated employees</span></p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li><span class="li">Wages owed must be paid via cash, direct deposit, payroll card or
               check by on or before the next regular payday on which the wages would otherwise be
               due. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">Fringe benefit payments (e.g., vacation pay) are not due by the next
               regular payday but payable based on the agreement between the employer and the
               employee. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">If the terminated employee requests that a check be issued and
               mailed for their final wages, the payment will be considered to have been made on the
               date the mailed payment is postmarked. </span></li>

         </ul>

      <section class="section" id="jlk1672211801208__section_N100A6_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Next Steps:</h2><p class="p">As of June 9, 2022, employers in West Virginia may pay employees at the employer's choosing via the methods noted above. In cases where the employer pays its employees via payroll card, the employer must be offered the option of being paid by electronic transfer (e.g.; direct deposit) instead. Where the necessary information for direct deposit is not provided by the employee, the employer may without employee agreement, pay the employee's wages via payroll card.</p>
