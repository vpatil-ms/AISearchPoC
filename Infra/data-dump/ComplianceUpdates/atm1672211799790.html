      <p class="p">The District of Columbia's chief financial officer has announced that there is already sufficient funding in a program offering paid family leave benefits to eligible employees to expand it and to reduce the employer contribution rate. As a result of the announcement, the changes will be implemented as soon as July 1, 2022.</p>

      <section class="section" id="atm1672211799790__section_N1004C_N10041_N10001"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Details:</h2>
         
         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Timing of the Changes:</span></p>

         <p class="p">The <a class="xref" href="https://dcpaidfamilyleave.dc.gov/employers/" target="_blank">Department of Employment Services</a> is determining how quickly it can implement
            the expansion of paid family leave and the reduction in the employer contribution rate.
            The soonest the changes could be implemented is July 1, 2022, but they may occur
            later.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">More Weeks of Paid Leave Benefits:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Once the changes are implemented, eligible employees will be entitled to
            more weeks of paid family leave. They will be able to receive a maximum of:</p>

         <ul class="ul" id="atm1672211799790__ul_asy_xd3_1yb">
            <li><span class="li">12 workweeks (up from 8 workweeks) of paid parental leave benefits
               within a 52-workweek period for bonding associated with: <ul class="ul" id="atm1672211799790__ul_bsy_xd3_1yb">
                  <li><span class="li">The birth of a child; </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The placement of a child for adoption or foster care; or </span></li>

                  <li><span class="li">The placement of a child for whom the employee legally assumes
                     and discharges parental responsibility. </span></li>

               </ul>
</span></li>

            <li><span class="li">12 workweeks (up from 6 workweeks) of paid family leave benefits
               within a 52-workweek period to provide care or companionship to a family member with
               a serious health condition. </span></li>

            <li><span class="li">12 workweeks (up from 6 workweeks) of paid medical leave benefits
               within a 52-workweek period for their own serious health condition. </span></li>

         </ul>

         <p class="p">Eligible employees are entitled to up to two workweeks of paid leave
            benefits for prenatal medical care. This is the same amount as under current rules.</p>

         <p class="p">Generally, employees will be eligible to receive no more than 12 weeks
            of paid family Leave benefits in a year, regardless of the number of qualifying
            events.</p>

         <p class="p"><span class="ph strong">Employer Contribution Rate to Be Lowered:</span></p>

         <p class="p">Once the changes take effect, the employer contribution rate will
            decrease from 0.62 percent to 0.26 percent. Note that The PFL tax rate will remain 0.62
            percent until the DC Council approves a new tax rate and effective date. Once an
            official effective date is established the Department of Employment Services will
            release updated guidance for employers.</p>
